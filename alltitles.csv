Building on the insightful comments of Campbell and Kenny and of Meehl, the authors utilized Monte Carlo simulations to highlight three major limitations of this control strategy (i.e., regression toward different means, systematic unmatching, and the generalizability of results) that they believe have received insufficient attention by researchers. Particular attention is given to how the effect of regression toward different means can result in researchers' drawing erroneous conclusions from their data. Recommendations for researchers considering the use of a matched-groups design are provided. ",,,,

Setting and.<h4>Participants</h4>Subjects were students from two cohorts in a Doctor of Nursing Practice program at a large metropolitan university in the Midwestern United States (n = 136).<h4>Methods</h4>Following a dramatic exercise facilitated by a local theatre group, students debriefed and provided feedback via paper-based surveys collected by their instructor. The research team reviewed and analyzed student feedback with an eye toward new learning or insights around cultural difference.<h4>Results</h4>Students rated the dramatic exercise highly. Their written feedback provided for a deeper exploration of how they internalized messages about cultural difference. These experiences were thematized in the following way: (a) Awareness is facilitated through integrating nonverbal (kinesthetic) and verbal encounters, (b) Hesitancy to participate in unfamiliar activities creates tension, and (c) Safety is a foundational aspect of learning sensitive issues.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Dramatization of culturally sensitive scenarios for advanced practice nurses can lead to new understanding. Educators who understand the need for thoughtful introduction of dramatization experiences can better prepare nurses for interaction in cross-cultural clinical environments.",,33302185.0,"['Cultural Competency', 'Drama', 'Graduate Nursing Education', 'Humans', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Curriculum', 'Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate', 'Students, Nursing', 'Teaching', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Midwestern United States']",

Consumers consider this label to be an important attribute when making a purchasing decision and billions of dollars are spent annually on these products. While many consumers believe Natural foods are healthier, heavy reliance on that assumption is misguided as “Natural” has no formal legal definition—it’s merely defined pursuant to an FDA approved informal policy. Another important health attribute in a consumer’s purchasing decision is the presence of natural flavors in food. However, unlike the term Natural, FDA has promulgated legally binding regulations for natural flavors. These flavors are currently the fourth most common food ingredient listed on food labels. In reality, “natural flavors” are a far cry from what consumers might expect, as they can contain both artificial and synthetic chemicals (often used as processing aids). Nonetheless, without a legally binding Natural regulation, there has been little opportunity to contest the naturalness of natural flavors in the past. Recently, FDA has initiated a notification of request for comments on use of the term Natural, so an attempt to promulgate regulations may be underway. Thus, it is appropriate to consider where natural flavors will fall if binding regulations are set forth. This article looks at the Natural debate, its history, and model regulatory standards worth considering. Within that context, it also provides a critical discussion concerning a misunderstood, yet federally regulated, ingredient that our society so heavily consumes: natural flavors.",,29140655.0,"['Humans', 'United States Department of Agriculture', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Food Labeling', 'United States', 'Terminology as Topic']",

To maximize this likelihood, it is important to consider common problems of implementation and assessment. This article addresses four challenges to effective implementation: (a) what counts as evidence of effectiveness, (b) how to know about such evidence, (c) how to implement with fidelity, and (d) how to align implementation with targeted outcomes. Assessment is critical to addressing the challenge of effective practice.

Three active regions are investigated: one 12-nm-thick single quantum well (SQW), two 6-nm-thick QWs, and three 4-nm-thick QWs. The IQE is highest for the 12-nm-thick SQW and decreases as the well width decreases. The radiative lifetimes are similar for all structures, while the nonradiative lifetimes decrease as the well width decreases. The superior IQE and longer nonradiative lifetime of the SQW structure suggests using thick SQW active regions for high brightness semipolar (202¯1¯) LEDs.",cc-by,29519065.0,,

To maximize this likelihood, it is important to consider common problems of implementation and assessment. This article addresses four challenges to effective implementation: (a) what counts as evidence of effectiveness, (b) how to know about such evidence, (c) how to implement with fidelity, and (d) how to align implementation with targeted outcomes. Assessment is critical to addressing the challenge of effective practice. Here, we examine three core areas of assessment in character education: (a) implementation (process evaluation), (b) school climate, and (c) character development (outcome assessment). ",,,,

The synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is a powerful method for instantaneous frequency estimation and component separation of non-stationary multicomponent signals. The short-time Fourier transform-based SST (FSST) reassigns the frequency variable to sharpen the time-frequency representation and to separate the components of a multicomponent non-stationary signal. Very recently the FSST with a time-varying parameter, called the adaptive FSST, was introduced. The simulation experiments show that the adaptive FSST is very promising in instantaneous frequency estimation of the component of a multicomponent signal, and in accurate component recovery.

In the Finney Avenue District, a nascent middle-class African American neighborhood, residents saw the post-tornado rebuilding program as an opportunity for civic improvement through the construction of new schools and housing. This grass-roots vision, however, ran up against the objectives and machinations of efficiency-minded city planners and profit-seeking developers. A micro-analysis of the rebuilding process sheds light on the racial politics of early 20th century urban redevelopment as well as the role of natural disasters in reshaping the urban landscape.

Since 1987, there have been several global initiatives oriented toward sustainable development, yet science educators have often remained silent with respect to ensuring the goals of science education are linked intrinsically to the central tenets of sustainable development. Why such silence? Where are the voices of science educators?In this position statement, I offer a rationale for expanding our views of science education to address sustainable development, empowerment, and social transformation. Science education ought to be a primary vehicle for addressing the current and emerging global challenges facing humanity. All too often, science educators merely focus upon fostering awareness and concern for global challenges. Such an orientation falls short of the education discourse that ought to be oriented toward addressing the goals, aspirations, desires, and needs of youth, who presently number 1.8 billion and represent the largest segment of the global population being underserved. The active engagement of youth in sustainable development efforts is imperative to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda. Youth are not mere beneficiaries of the 2030 Agenda; they have a critical role in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).I offer a rationale for why science educators ought to become active agents in facilitating the engagement of youth in addressing global challenges facing humanity.

The complex trauma definition has been examined in adults, as indicated by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM‐IV) field trial; however, this research was lacking in child populations. The symptom presentations of complexly traumatized children were contrasted with those exposed to other, less severe trauma ecologies that met 1 or 2 features of the complex trauma definition. Included in this study were 346 treatment‐seeking children and adolescents (ages 3–18 years) who had experienced a traumatic event. Results indicated that child survivors of complex trauma presented with higher levels of generalized behavior problems and trauma‐related symptoms than those who experienced (a) acute noninterpersonal trauma, (b) chronic interpersonal trauma that begins later in life, and (c) acute interpersonal trauma. Greater levels of behavioral problems were observed in children exposed to complex trauma as compared to those who experienced a traumatic event that begins early in life. These results provide support for the complex trauma event definition and suggest the need for a complex trauma diagnostic construct for children and adolescents.",,,,

Using the same coding method, the 2011 JIT article, ‘Business Process Outsourcing Studies: A Critical Review and Research Directions,’ analyzed 615 findings on the determinants of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) decisions and outcomes from 67 empirical articles published between 1996 and 2011. Taken together, these two reviews found that the preponderance of evidence from both ITO and BPO research streams produced largely consistent results pertaining to the categories of independent variables that affected outsourcing decisions and outcomes. To investigate the most current research findings on business services, which comprise ITO and BPO, and to compare the results with the prior JIT reviews, we replicated the method used in the prior JIT reviews. In this update, we examined 174 newly published articles across 78 academic journals published between 2010 and 2014. We found that researchers have significantly expanded the variables of interest in the last 4 years. In all, researchers investigated 69 new variables. Compared with earlier research, this review of recent articles found a deeper exploration of the direct effects of transaction attributes, sourcing motivations, client and provider capabilities, and governance on sourcing decisions and outcomes. Researchers have also studied a broader variety of sourcing decisions, including shared services, captive centers, rural sourcing and backsourcing. This update also found a more nuanced understanding of relational governance and its interaction with contractual governance. We assessed the research progress that has been made on ten previously identified gaps in knowledge. We proposed a future research agenda that includes continued, incremental progress on ‘normal science’ research questions, as well as more ambitious research goals. We challenged researchers to investigate how sourcing clients, providers, and advisors can protect jobs, protect the environment, and ensure security in an increasingly automated world. ",,,,

The case focuses on how one UK-based firm – Radiant Law – completely rethought the delivery of legal services. This ‘new age’ law firm continually tested the boundaries of new ways to leverage the value of global talent and technology. For example, it changed its pricing and sourcing models, adopted new technologies, hired freelance IT professionals globally to develop software to streamline its legal work, engaged outsourcing providers in India and (subsequently) in South Africa. After nearly 3 years in South Africa, Radiant Law contemplated switching its sourcing model again. The Radiant Law story supports discussion about challenges associated with global sourcing decisions and the present and future shape of professional work and services in an increasingly technology-enabled, globalized world.

However, their efficiency is marred by a necessity to chemically modify DOX, NPs, or both and low deposition of the administered NPs on tumors. Therefore, alternative strategies should be developed to improve therapeutic efficacy and decrease toxicity. Here we report the possibility of employing a monolithic nanoporous gold (np-Au) rod as an implant for delivering DOX. The np-Au has very high DOX encapsulation efficiency (&gt;98%) with maximum loading of 93.4 mg cm−3 without any chemical modification required of DOX or np-Au. We provide a plausible mechanism for the high loading of DOX in np-Au. The DOX sustained release for 26 days from np-Au in different pH conditions at 37 °C, which was monitored using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Additionally, we encased the DOX-loaded np-Au with rapamycin (RAPA)-trapped poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) to fabricate an np-Au@PLGA/RAPA implant and optimized the combinatorial release of DOX and RAPA. Further exploiting the effect of the protein corona around np-Au and np-Au@PLGA/RAPA showed zero-order release kinetics of DOX. This work proves that the np-Au-based implant has the potential to be used as a DOX carrier of potential use in cancer treatment.",cc-by-4.0,,,

The intention of this review is to discuss and summarize work reported in this area during the period 2015–2021 as a follow-up to our prior review. Reports from the past three decades have already proven the advantages of monolithic materials, such as the ease with which they can be prepared and functionalized, their high permeability and low resistance to mass transfer, and their stability over a wide range of pH. Recent works on glycoprotein analysis introduce different strategies in using monolithic materials specifically in separation, enrichment, and identification of glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and free glycans. A majority of these are focused on boronic acid affinity-based technique and others on lectin affinity and HILIC-based techniques. There are also newly developed ligands that utilize different interactions with glycans, such as encapsulation into β-cyclodextrin vesicles, CH- or OH-π interactions with fullerenes, immunoaffinity with monoclonal antibodies, H-bonding interactions with metallophthalocyanines, coordination interactions with cobalt phthalocyanine tetracarboxylic acid, and hydrophilic interaction with cyclodextrin molecular tubes, zwitterionic iminodiacetic acid, and boric acid. Recent strategies for developing on-line, multidimensional systems use immobilized monolithic enzyme reactors (IMERs) for high-throughput glycoprotein analysis. These works serve as contributions to better understand glycan structure-function relationship, as glycoproteins are now widely accepted disease biomarkers.",cc-by-4.0,,,

The main feature of the action of glycoalkaloids is their strong binding to 3β-hydroxysterols, such as cholesterol, to form complexes with the consequence that membrane structure is significantly perturbed, and leakage or release of contents inside cells or liposomes becomes possible. The glycoalkaloids have been studied for their ability to inhibit the growth of cancer cells and in other roles such as vaccine adjuvants and as synergistic agents when combined with other therapeutics. The glycoalkaloids have rich and complex physical behavior when interacting with model membranes for which many aspects are yet to be understood. This review introduces the general properties of glycoalkaloids and aspects of their behavior, and then summarizes their effects against model membrane systems.

Chemical and biological sensors based on plasmonic nanomaterials are well-established and commercially available, but the role of plasmonic nanomaterials on photothermal therapeutics, solar cells, super-resolution imaging, organic synthesis, etc. is still emerging. The effectiveness of the plasmonic materials on these technologies depends on their stability and sensitivity. Preparing plasmonics-active nanostructured thin films (PANTFs) on a solid substrate improves their physical stability. More importantly, the surface plasmons of thin film and that of nanostructures can couple in PANTFs enhancing the sensitivity. A PANTF can be used as a transducer for any of the three plasmonic-based sensing techniques, namely, the propagating surface plasmon, localized surface plasmon resonance, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy-based sensing techniques. Additionally, continuous nanostructured metal films have an advantage for implementing electrical controls such as simultaneous sensing using both plasmonic and electrochemical techniques. Although research and development on PANTFs have been rapidly advancing, very few reviews on synthetic methods have been published. In this review, we provide some fundamental and practical aspects of plasmonics along with the recent advances in PANTFs synthesis, focusing on the advantages and shortcomings of the fabrication techniques.

We analyse an agent-based null model, considering a case without selection—neutral evolution—in which organisms are defined only by phenotype. Universal dynamics has previously been demonstrated in a related model on a neutral fitness landscape, showing that this system belongs to the directed percolation (DP) universality class. The traditional null condition of neutral fitness (where fitness is defined as the number of offspring each organism produces) is extended here to include equal probability of death among organisms. We identify two types of phase transition: (i) a non-equilibrium DP transition through generational time (i.e. survival), and (ii) an equilibrium ordinary percolation transition through the phenotype space (based on links between mating organisms). Owing to the dynamical rules of the DP reaction–diffusion process, organisms can only sparsely fill the phenotype space, resulting in significant phenotypic diversity within a cluster of mating organisms. This highlights the necessity of understanding hierarchical evolutionary relationships, rather than merely developing taxonomies based on phenotypic similarity, in order to develop models that can explain phylogenetic patterns found in the fossil record or to make hypotheses for the incomplete fossil record of deep time.",cc-by,,,

This dynamical phenomenon has recently been studied in computational models and demonstrated experimentally in mechanical, optical, and chemical systems. The theoretical basis of these states is currently under active investigation. Chimera behavior is of particular relevance in the context of neural synchronization, given the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep and the recent observation of asymmetric sleep in human patients with sleep apnea. The similarity of neural chimera states to neural “bump” states, which have been suggested as a model for working memory and visual orientation tuning in the cortex, adds to their interest as objects of study. Chimera states have been demonstrated in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of excitable cells and in the Hindmarsh-Rose neural model. Here, we demonstrate chimera states and chimera-like behaviors in a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of thermally sensitive neurons both in a system with Abrams-Strogatz (mean field) coupling and in a system with Kuramoto (distance-dependent) coupling. We map the regions of parameter space for which chimera behavior occurs in each of the two coupling schemes.",,,,

In a two-hemisphere model, we find differences in the behavior of the sleep-promototing or wake-promoting regions between hemispheres, indicative of chimera-like behavior. We observe phase-cluster states, in which different hemispheres exhibit different bursting dynamics, as well as differences in synchronization between hemispheres. This provides a basis for modeling unihemispheric sleep, which occurs naturally in cetaceans and some bird species, among others, as well as asymmetric sleep, which occurs in human subjects suffering from sleep apnea or experiencing the “first night effect” induced by sleeping in a novel environment.",cc-by-4.0,,,

            SIGNIFICANCE
            Men earn at least 6.5% more than women in their first full-time jobs as optometrists. For current salaries, the gender wage gap is more than 13%. This study details the gender wage gap that remains after controlling for practice ownership, residency training, and employer-defined full-time work.
          
          
            PURPOSE
            The purpose of this study was to measure the gender wage gap by region and practice type for full-time optometrists who did not complete a residency and do not own their practice.
          
          
            METHODS
            Participants completed an online survey, providing data for their first and current optometry positions and demographic information. Respondents who reported full-time employment in the United States, not completing a residency, and not owning their practice were selected for further analysis by census region and practice type. In each category, the gender wage gap was calculated.
          
          
            RESULTS
            In all regions and practice types, men were paid higher starting salaries than women. For current salaries, men were paid higher in almost all regions and practice types. The wage gap increased from starting salary to current salary, although not in all regions and practice types.
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            When practice ownership, residency completion, and full-time work are controlled for, there remains a difference in the pay received by men and women in optometry. The salary data presented in this study may help optometrists narrow the wage gap.

Implicit in this definition is the dominant eye has better visual function. Several studies have investigated the effect of visual direction or defocus on ocular dominance, but there is less evidence connecting ocular dominance and monocular visual thresholds. We used the classic “hole in card” method to determine the dominant eye for 28 adult observers (11 males and 17 females). We then compared contrast thresholds between the dominant and non-dominant eyes using grating stimuli biased to be processed more strongly either by the magnocellular (MC) or parvocellular (PC) pathway. Using non-parametric mean rank tests, the dominant eye was more sensitive overall than the non-dominant eye to both stimuli (z = −2.54, p = 0.01). The dominant eye was also more sensitive to the PC-biased stimulus (z = −2.22, p = 0.03) but not the MC-biased stimulus (z = −1.16, p = 0.25).

For chromatic objects, the transformation is more complex, depending on color purity as well. This influence of color purity on a color's perceived brightness is a well-established phenomenon known as the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch (H-K) effect. We investigated gender differences in the H-K effect by measuring brightness (via direct brightness matching [DBM]) and luminance (via heterochromatic flicker photometry [HFP]) at five wavelengths (450, 520, 560, 580, and 650 nm) perceived as blue, green, green-yellow, yellow, and red hues. We compared DBM/HFP ratios between 13 males and 18 females. Based on previous evidence of a female advantage in chromatic processes, we hypothesized that DBM/HFP ratios would be higher in female subjects. While HFP measures were essentially the same between male and female subjects, DBM measures and DBM/HFP ratios were significantly higher for female subjects than males. There were no significant effects of contraceptive use based on a post hoc comparison. We also derived simple models of brightness as a function of luminance and saturation, which further suggest gender dimorphism in the H-K effect.",,32552489.0,"['Gender', 'Contraception', 'Brightness', 'Chromaticity', 'Helmholtz–kohlrausch Effect', 'Relative Luminosity', 'Humans', 'Color Perception', 'Psychophysics', 'Sex Factors', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Male', 'Young Adult']",

Two waves of single-respondent data were collected from the same U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs) in 1993 and 2003. These data are used to test hypotheses that internationalization affects how successfully a U.S. MNC manages its relationships with social and political stakeholders in its nonmarket environment. The results of this unique study indicate that the number of countries in which the MNC operates and its percentages of foreign employees, foreign assets, and foreign sales are associated with the public affairs strategies that MNCs use in nonmarket environments. The study differentiates these strategies into social or political buffering and social or political bridging. Significant differences exist across the two time periods in the impact of percentage of foreign employees on social buffering and the impact of political buffering on political affairs performance. The study elaborates the implications of these findings. ",,,,

               Purpose
                – The purpose of this paper is to use a stochastic dominance test to examine the relative performance of value vs growth stocks based on multiple value-growth proxies in the Taiwan stock market. 
            
            
               Design/methodology/approach
                – This work examines whether the return distribution of a value portfolio stochastically dominates that of a growth portfolio using a test proposed by Linton et al. (2005). 
            
            
               Findings
                – By applying stochastic dominance analysis on the full-sample period, the sub-sample period and the state of the world’s economic conditions, the authors find that the earnings-to-price or dividend-to-price ratio is better than the book-to-market ratio as a value-growth proxy in Taiwan. There are robust results even after adjusting for data frequency, a sampling method and sample excluding financial services. 
            
            
               Originality/value
                – This study makes the first attempt to examine value vs growth strategies based on multiple value-growth proxies in the emerging market of Taiwan by administering the stochastic dominance test.

               Purpose
                – Prior studies in citation-based journal rankings tend to be static to compare across journals. One journal may be judged better in citations than other journals at some points in time but not at the others. The assumption that the citation distribution is normally distributed and that the citation observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) may not be appropriate. The paper aims to discuss these issues. 
            
            
               Design/methodology/approach
                – This study uses a stochastic dominance (SD) analysis, which overcomes the dynamic nature of changes in citation over time. The SD method proposed by Linton, Maasoumi, and Whang (hereafter LMW, 2005) does not require the data to be i.i.d. We use the LMW method to compare the relative ranking of 23 finance journals using citations for all articles from them during 1990-2010. 
            
            
               Findings
                – The study indicates that the citation distribution changes over time. Thus a SD analysis is a better approach for a comparison of journal ranking. The findings unambiguously place JF, JFE, RFS, JFQA, and JFI in the top five spots of the finance journal ranking. The “near-top” journals, such as JBF, JCF, and FM, are not clear cut in the SD analysis. 
            
            
               Research limitations/implications
                – The results confirm that ranking for the lower ranked journals may change over time especially, but the top three journals appear to be robust across methods and over time. 
            
            
               Originality/value
                – The results of SD analysis provides more convincing evidence on finance journal ranking and could be useful to rank academic institutions, faculty research quality, and help the authors to decide what to read and which journals are influential.

Coauthors who do not act as if they were senior authors undermine coauthorship collaboration, resulting in lower citations on the article.

Many methods generalized from the Prony method have been developed to solve this problem; however, the current research mainly deals with the functions represented in sparse expansions using a single generating function. In this paper, we generalize the Prony method to solve the sparse expansion problem for two generating functions, so that more types of functions can be recovered by Prony-type methods. The two-generator sparse expansion problem has some special properties. For example, the two sets of frequencies need to be separated from the zeros of the Prony polynomial. We propose a two-stage least-square detection method to solve this problem effectively.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Research has established that department policies regarding officers’ use of deadly force effected firearm use and led to reductions in incidents of officers discharging their weapon. There is a noticeable lack of similar evidence on the effects of policy changes regarding the use of non-lethal force. This study describes the results of an assessment of the effect that a change in policy governing a specific type of non-lethal force—TASERs—in one major police department had on officers’ use of the device. The results show that a move to a more restrictive TASER policy led to a reduction in TASER use. The study also reports on the role that factors besides policy play in officers’ TASER usage. ,,,,

            BACKGROUND
            Use of force [UOF] by police can result in serious injuries and fatalities. The risk of significant injuries associated with different force modalities is poorly defined. We sought to determine the incidence of police UOF and compare the likelihood of significant injury with different force modalities.
          
          
            METHODS
            A prospective multicenter observational study of all UOF incidents was conducted via mandatory UOF investigations at three mid-sized police agencies over a two year period. Expert physicians reviewed police and medical records to determine injury severity using a priori injury severity stratification criteria.
          
          
            RESULTS
            There were 893 UOF incidents, representing a UOF rate of 0.086% of 1,041,737 calls for service (1 in 1167) and 0.78% of 114,064 criminal arrests(1 in 128). Suspects were primarily young (mean age, 31 years; range, 12–86 years) males (89%). The 1,399 force utilizations included unarmed physical force (n = 710, 51%), CEWs (504, 30%), chemical (88, 6.3%), canines (47, 3.4%), impact weapons (9, 0.6%), kinetic impact munitions (8, 0.6%), firearms (6, 0.4%), and other (27, 1.9%). Among 914 suspects, 898 (98%) sustained no or mild injury after police UOF. Significant (moderate or severe) injuries occurred in 16 (1.8%) subjects. Logistic regression analysis shows these are most associated with firearm and canine use. There was one fatality (0.1%) due to gunshots. No significant injuries occurred among 504 CEW uses (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0.0–0.9%). Of the 355 suspects transported to a medical facility, 78 (22%) were hospitalized. The majority of hospitalizations were unrelated to UOF (n = 59, 76%), whereas a minority (n = 19, 24%) were due to injuries related to police UOF.
          
          
            CONCLUSION
            Police UOF is rare. When force is used officers most commonly rely on unarmed physical force and CEWs. Significant injuries are rare. Transport for medical evaluation is a poor surrogate for significant injury due to UOF.

A pilot study and ongoing data integration suggest greater coverage than extant data sets. Advantages of the FE data include circumstance of death specificity, incident geo-locations, identification of involved police-agencies, and near immediate availability of data. Disadvantages include a high rate of missingness for decedent race/ethnicity, potentially higher rates of missing incidents in older data, and the exclusion of more comprehensive police use-of-force and nonlethal use-of-force data-a critique applicable to all extant data sets.<h4>Conclusions</h4>FE is the largest collection of PRDs in the United States and remains as the most likely source for historical trend comparisons and police-department level analyses of the causes of PRDs.",cc-by,37073367.0,"['Police Homicides', 'Police-Related-Deaths']",PMC10109543

Focusing on Germany, this study reviews educational statistics pertaining to youth of migrant origin, showing that conflicts over Islamic instruction mirror deeper patterns of minority discrimination. It outlines the legal hurdles new faith communities must overcome to secure recognition as “corporate entities under public law” (Körperschaftsstatus), entitling them to accredited teacher training, tax-funded salaries, construction subsidies, and other institutional privileges. It describes divergent curricular models utilized by the Länder, followed by a closer look at Islamic instruction in Berlin, where a court ruling compelled authorities to take a pro-active approach. It concludes with a review of dilemmas inherent in Germany's approach to “value education” against the backdrop of the new European Union anti-discrimination directives.Show me any mischief produced by the madness or wickedness of theologians, and I will show you a hundred resulting from the ambition and villany of conquerors and statesmen.

The different parts of our argument are illustrated with data from a three-year ethnographic study of science in one community. These data feature adult residents who were dealing with the contested issue of whether or not to extend the existing water main in order to supply with water a part of the community that, at the time, had to rely on seasonally contaminated wells.

One of the well-known frameworks for organizing, developing, and deploying predictive machine learning models is cross-industry standard for data mining (CRISP-DM). However, the framework does not provide any guidelines for detecting and mitigating different types of fairness-related biases in the development of ML applications. The study of these biases is a relatively recent stream of research. To address this significant theoretical and practical gap, we propose a new framework—Fair CRISP-DM, which groups and maps these biases corresponding to each phase of an ML application development. Through this study, we contribute to the literature on ML development and fairness. We present recommendations to ML researchers on including fairness as part of the ML evaluation process. Further, ML practitioners can use our framework to identify and mitigate fairness-related biases in each phase of an ML project development. Finally, we also discuss emerging technologies which can help developers to detect and mitigate biases in different stages of ML application development.",,,,

These findings are reinforced through in-depth interviews with 59 participants and 25 controls in an experiment testing the effects of Individual Development Accounts (IDAs). All respondents are from low-income households. IDA participants appear more likely than control respondents to earmark savings for long-term purposes and asset investments. This could be interpreted as a result of the institutional saving structure provided through the IDA program. IDA participants are presented with savings goals, which they believe are made attainable through conveyed expectations, matching funds, financial information, and staff facilitation. Interviews suggest that savings may lead to psychological, behavioral, and economic effects. Future research can explore the distinct and marginal effect that each institutional dimension has on savings over the long term and the effects of savings on family well being.",,,,

Two embedded, entwined, and exceptional American institutions—broad private property rights and competitive federalism—are necessary for explaining this shift. These two institutions shaped the exceptional stringency of 1970s American environmental laws and the powerful backlash against these laws that continues today. American colonies ensured broad private rights to use land and natural resources for profit. The colonies and the independent state governments that followed wielded expansive authority to govern this commodified environment. In the 1780s, Congress underwrote state governance of the privatized environment by directing the parceling and transfer of federal land to private parties and of environmental governance to future states. The 1787 Constitution cemented these relationships and exposed states to interstate economic competition. Environmental laws of the 1970s imposed unprecedented challenges to the environmental prerogatives long protected by these institutions, and the beneficiaries responded with a wide-ranging counterattack. Federalism enabled this opposition to build powerful regional alliances to stymie action on climate change. These overlooked institutional factors are necessary to explain why Canadian and American environmental policies have diverged.",,,,

This paper describes a case study of the development of a visualization component to represent regional relationship data. It addresses the specific information goals of the target organization, various constraints that needed to be satisfied, and how the goals were achieved via a suitable choice of visualization technology and visualization algorithms. The development process highlighted the need for specific visualizations to be driven by the specific problem characteristics as much as general rules of visualization.

Many basic facts about the levels and changes in crime are not known or well understood, posing significant problems for crime policy development and evaluation, particularly in the areas of crimes by and against businesses, organizations, and governments and crimes against the environment. We discuss the new crime classification system in an effort to engage criminologists and practitioners in the work that is necessary to improve our responses to crime.",,,,

We show that an information-theory-inspired model of attention-focus on correlation layers, which looks in/out from the boundaries of skin, family, and culture, predicts that behaviorally diverse communities may tend toward a characteristic task-layer multiplicity per individual of only e29/20≅ 4.26 of the six correlation layers that comprise that community. This behavioral measure of opportunity may help us to (i) go beyond GDP in quantifying the impact of policy changes and disasters, (ii) manage electronic idea-streams in ways that strengthen community networks, and (iii) leverage our paleolithic shortcomings toward the enhancement of community-level task-layer diversity.

There have been no explicit tests of their hypotheses. Indeed there were no proposed mechanisms either at the time or since by which herbivores might generate new plant species. Here we outline two main classes of mechanisms, prezygotic and postzygotic, with a number of scenarios in each by which herbivore‐driven changes in host plant secondary chemistry might lead to new plant lineage production. The former apply mainly to a sympatric model of speciation while the latter apply to a parapatric or allopatric model. Our review suggests that the steps of each mechanism are known to occur individually in many different systems, but no scenario has been thoroughly investigated in any one system. Nevertheless, studies of Dalechampia and its herbivores and pollinators, and patterns of defense tradeoffs in trees on different soil types in the Peruvian Amazon provide evidence consistent with the original hypotheses of Ehrlich and Raven. For herbivores to drive sympatric speciation, our findings suggest that interactions with both their herbivores and their pollinators should be considered. In contrast, herbivores may drive speciation allopatrically without any influence by pollinators. Finally, there is evidence that these mechanisms are more likely to occur at low latitudes and thus more likely to produce new species in the tropics. The mechanisms we outline provide a predictive framework for further study of the general role that herbivores play in diversification of their host plants.","publisher-specific, author manuscript",,,

Recent evidence suggests that natural enemies could play an important role in the assembly of hyper-diverse tropical plant systems. Classic ecological theory predicts that in order for coexistence to occur, species differences must be maximized across biologically important niche dimensions. For plant-herbivore interactions, it has been recently suggested that, within a particular community, plant species that maximize the difference in chemical defense profiles compared to neighboring taxa will have a relative competitive advantage. Here we tested the hypothesis that plant chemical diversity can affect local community composition in the hyper-diverse genus Piper at a lowland wet forest location in Costa Rica. We first characterized the chemical composition of 27 of the most locally abundant species of Piper. We then tested whether species with different chemical compositions were more likely to coexist. Finally, we assessed the degree to which Piper phylogenetic relationships are related to differences in secondary chemical composition and community assembly. We found that, on average, co-occurring species were more likely to differ in chemical composition than expected by chance. Contrary to expectations, there was no phylogenetic signal for overall secondary chemical composition. In addition we found that species in local communities were, on average, more phylogenetically closely related than expected by chance, suggesting that functional traits other than those measured here also influence local assembly. We propose that selection by herbivores for divergent chemistries between closely related species facilitates the coexistence of a high diversity of congeneric taxa via apparent competition.",,27870051.0,"['herbivory', 'Apparent competition', 'Coexistence', 'Tropics', 'Secondary compounds', 'Defense', 'Costa Rica', 'La Selva', 'Lowland Wet Forest', 'Piper', 'Ecosystem', 'Phylogeny', 'Species Specificity']",

For plant-herbivore interactions, it has been hypothesized that when plant species diversity is reduced, loss of plant biomass to herbivores increases. Although long-standing, this hypothesis has received mixed support. Increasing plant chemical diversity with increasing plant taxonomic diversity is likely to be important for plant-herbivore interactions at the community level, but the role of chemical diversity is unexplored. Here we assess the effect of volatile chemical diversity on patterns of herbivore damage in naturally occurring patches of Piper (Piperaceae) shrubs in a Costa Rican lowland wet forest. Volatile chemical diversity negatively affected total, specialist, and generalist herbivore damage. Furthermore, there were differences between the effects of high-volatility and low-volatility chemical diversity on herbivore damage. High-volatility diversity reduced specialist herbivory, while low-volatility diversity reduced generalist herbivory. Our data suggest that, although increased plant diversity is expected to reduce average herbivore damage, this pattern is likely mediated by the diversity of defensive compounds and general classes of anti-herbivore traits, as well as the degree of specialization of the herbivores attacking those plants.",,27129320.0,"['Piper', 'Volatile compounds', 'herbivory', 'La Selva', 'Plant Interactions', 'Plants', 'Ecosystem', 'Biodiversity', 'Herbivory', 'Forests']",

These cases emphasize the importance of ethics driving accountants' decisions.Design/methodology/approachThe paper discusses these ethical lapses in light of applying Kohlberg's models, biblical examples from the Old and New Testaments and the Koran, and other ethical systems.FindingsThe paper shows that this concept is not new. Throughout history, people have taken actions that cost them their freedom, their money and most importantly, their good names. Upon reflection, many of these people are astounded at the seriousness of their action given what little they had to gain from continued involvement. In reinforcing lessons that should be learned from cases of business malfeasance and highlighting many well‐known accounting and other scandals, we develop recurrent themes in the nature of business scandals and show that many people are responsible for or complicit in the malfeasance. These individuals could have prevented the fraud or minimized any adverse impact if they had considered their behavior ex ante. We show that the employees portrayed demonstrated very low‐levels of ethical development and seemed to underestimate the probability of getting caught and the resulting punishment. We also elicit many reasons from several viewpoints for not becoming involved in fraud.Research limitations/implicationsIt is hoped that the next generation of business leaders and middle level staff alike will consider the results/messages of this paper when faced with ethical dilemmas.Practical implicationsThe paper concludes that the best internal control in a business structure remains the hiring and training of morally upstanding employees and managers who recognize the values of their good names before temptations arise. Incentive plans can encourage ethical behavior.Originality/valuePractitioners must consider fully the potential consequences of their actions no matter how small the perceived probability of a bad outcome.",,,,

In this paper, we report on a study to design an omnichannel distribution system for Total Hockey, a growing U.S. sporting goods retailer in a competitive environment. Management strongly believes that e-commerce success will depend on high service levels characterized by one- or two-day delivery and initially thought that a new omnichannel warehouse located on the East Coast could support its expansion plans. To study the situation, we developed a profit-maximizing optimization model for locating omnichannel warehouses that supports both e-commerce and store shipments. The model uses estimates of e-commerce demand by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) across the United States, while incorporating management’s sales expectations regarding the value of high service levels, e-commerce sales lost to competitors’ stores, and reverse cannibalism from Total Hockey’s own retail stores. Multiple warehouse sizes allow modeling of nonlinear inventory costs. The facility-location optimization model allows exploration of multiple solutions and an assessment of the impact of higher service levels. The results of the study were contrary to management expectations and suggested a significant redesign of the distribution system.

In this article, we provide a literature survey on optimization approaches to civil applications of UAVs. Our goal is to provide a fast point of entry into the topic for interested researchers and operations planning specialists.

This opens the door for the use of vaccine delivery by drones (uncrewed aerial vehicles, or UAVs) with their fast transportation and reliance on little or no infrastructure. In this paper, we study the problem of strategic multimodal vaccine distribution, which simultaneously determines the locations of local distribution centers, drone bases, and drone relay stations, while obeying the cold chain time limit and drone range. Two mathematical optimization models with complementary strengths are developed. The first model considers the vaccine travel time at the aggregate level with a compact formulation, but it can be too conservative in meeting the cold chain time limit. The second model is based on the layered network framework to track the vaccine flow and travel time associated with each origin-destination (OD) pair. It allows the number of transshipments and the number of drone stops in a vaccine flow path to be limited, which reflects practical operations and can be computationally advantageous. Both models are applied for vaccine distribution network design with two types of drones in Vanuatu as a case study. Solutions with drones using our parameter settings are shown to generate large savings, with differentiated roles for large and small drones. To generalize the empirical findings and examine the performance of our models, we conduct comprehensive computational experiments to assess the sensitivity of optimal solutions and performance metrics to key problem parameters.

The genomes of 10 of these strains were sequenced and compared with each other, with other symbiotic cyanobacterial strains, and with similar strains that were not isolated from a symbiotic association. The 10 strains fell into three distinct groups: six strains were nearly identical to the non-symbiotic strain,

                   sp. 2RC was unusual because it has three sets of nitrogenase genes; it has complete gene clusters for two distinct Mo-nitrogenases and an alternative V-nitrogenase. Genes for Mo-nitrogenase, sugar transport, chemotaxis and pili characterized all the symbiotic strains. Several of the strains infected the liverwort Blasia, including N. variabilis ATCC 29413, which did not originate from Azolla but rather from a sewage pond. However, only

With the development of the tools of synthetic biology, more progress has been made toward this goal in the last 5 years than in the previous five decades. Most of the effort has focused on nitrogenase genes from Klebsiella oxytoca, which has complex gene regulation. There may be advantages in using nitrogenase genes from cyanobacteria, which comprise large polycistronic gene clusters that may be easier to manipulate and eventually express in a plant. The fact that some diatoms have a cyanobacterial nitrogen fixing organelle further supports the idea that a cyanobacterial nitrogenase gene cluster may function in a newly-engineered, cyanobacterial-based plant organelle, a nitroplast.

Associated with each of these clusters is a putative regulatory gene called cnfR (patB) whose product has a C-terminal HTH domain and an N-terminal ferredoxin-like domain. CnfR1 activates nifB1 expression in heterocysts, while CnfR2 activates nifB2 expression. A cnfR1 mutant was unable to make nitrogenase under aerobic conditions in heterocysts while the cnfR2 mutant was unable to make nitrogenase under anaerobic conditions. Mutations in cnfR1 and cnfR2 reduced transcripts for the nif1 and nif2 genes respectively. The closely related cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 has the nif1 system but lacks nif2. Expression of nifB2:lacZ from A. variabilis in anaerobic vegetative cells of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 depended on the presence of cnfR2.

The two large nif gene clusters responsible for these two nitrogenases are under the control of the promoter of the first gene in the operon, nifB1 or nifB2 Despite differences in the expression patterns of nifB1 and nifB2, related to oxygen and cell type, the regions upstream of their transcription start sites (tss) show striking homology, including three highly conserved sequences (CS). CS1, CS2, and the region just upstream from the tss were required for optimal expression from the nifB1 promoter, but CS3 and the 5' untranslated region (UTR) were not. Hybrid fusions of the nifB1 and nifB2 upstream regions revealed that the region including CS1, CS2, and CS3 of nifB2 could substitute for the similar region of nifB1; however, the converse was not true. Expression from the nifB2 promoter region required the CS1, CS2, and CS3 regions of nifB2 and also required the nifB2 5' UTR. A hybrid promoter that was mostly nifB2 but that had the region from about position -40 to the tss of nifB1 was expressed in heterocysts and in anoxic vegetative cells. Thus, addition of the nifB1 promoter region (from about position -40 to the tss of nifB1) in the nifB hybrid promoter supported expression in heterocysts but did not prevent the mostly nifB2 promoter from also functioning in anoxic vegetative cells. In the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis, two Mo nitrogenase gene clusters, nif1 and nif2, function under different environmental conditions in different cell types. Little is known about the regulation of transcription from the promoter upstream of the first gene of the cluster, which drives transcription of each of these two large operons. The similarity in the sequences upstream of the primary promoters for the two nif gene clusters belies the differences in their expression patterns. Analysis of these nif promoters in strains with mutations in the conserved sequences and in strains with hybrid promoters, comprising parts from nif1 and nif2, provides strong evidence that each promoter has key elements required for cell-type-specific expression of the nif1 and nif2 gene clusters.",,27920300.0,"['Anabaena variabilis', 'Nitrogenase', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Base Sequence', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",PMC5287400

They find that there are competitive dynamics that affect TIF use: Being adjacent to another city that uses TIF increases the likelihood that a city will approve a TIF. The study finds evidence that TIF adoption patterns contribute to intermunicipal inequality, and it provides some support for the importance of path dependency in TIF use. ",,,,

The article aims to demonstrate that meaning in fiction can be incorporated in an explanatory network that includes the whole scope of human behavior. In both reality and fiction, meaning consists of experiences in individual minds: sensations, emotions, perceptions, and thoughts. Writing and reading fiction involve 3 sets of minds, those of authors, readers, and characters. Meaning in the minds of authors and readers emerges in relation to the experiences of fictional characters. Characters engage in motivated actions. To understand minds and meaning in fiction, researchers need analytic categories for human motives. A comprehensive model of human motives can be constructed by integrating ideas from evolutionary biology, anthropology, and psychology. Motives combine in different ways to produce different cultures and different individual identities, which influence experience in individual minds. The mental experiences produced in authors and readers by fictional narratives have adaptive psychological functions. By encompassing the minds of authors, characters, and readers within a comprehensive model of human motives, this article situates the psychology of fiction within the larger research program of the evolutionary social sciences.",,,,

This paper aims to identify factors that predict consumers’ attitudes and intentions toward usage of Instagram, a relatively new social media tool. In addition, it examines the role of an important dimension of culture – individualism vs collectivism –to determine cultural influences on the adoption of social media in the USA (i.e. an individualistic culture) and Kuwait (i.e. a collectivist culture).Design/methodology/approachData were collected from a convenience sample of undergraduate business and MBA students from Kuwait and the USA. To validate the measures for the constructs depicted in the conceptual model, the authors conducted an exploratory factor analysis using all items. They then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to further evaluate the adequacy and validity of the measurement model. They also tested the hypotheses using structural equation modeling (SEM).FindingsOut of the nine hypotheses that were tested for significance, the SEM results indicated that seven hypotheses were significant. The results indicated a non-significant result between perceived critical mass is not a predictor of perceived usefulness and social influence to attitude.Research limitations/implicationsThe current study has some limitations that need to be recognized and can be used as guidelines for future research. First, college students represent only a portion of online users and may impact the external validity of our study. Hence, a more diverse sample with a broader range of ages, incomes, education levels, cultures and national origins would be advisable. Second, this study featured a dynamically continuous innovation (Instagram) rather than a discontinuous innovation. Third, other factors can be carried out to see other variables other than those described in this study to predict consumer’s attitude and intention to use the social media.Practical implicationsCultural characteristics such as individualism/collectivism would seem to be potentially useful when segmenting countries. The results of the current study indicate that the modified model is applicable to a cross-national group of social media users. This study demonstrates the impact of cultural characteristics on various technology adoption. Hence, managers must be aware that countries can be grouped according to the type of cultural effect within each. Each social media category, clusters can be formed consisting of countries that are expected to have similar usage patterns based on technological capability and social norms. By understanding the factors that influence each cluster of countries, firms can design customized social media programs.Social implicationsThis research provides valuable information to better understand the consumers’ attitudes and intentions toward the emerging social media landscape. Indeed, the popularity of social media has greatly changed the way in which people communicate in today’s world. In particular, Instagram has gradually become a major communication media for both social and business purposes. This research shed light into the factors that influence intentions to adopt social media across different cultures. It empirically examines the role of culture – individualism vs collectivism – by using two samples (i.e. Kuwait and the USA) to determine cultural influences on the adoption of social media in different cultures.Originality/valueUsing data drawn from Kuwait and US samples, this current study draws upon the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975) and the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989). The results of the analysis indicate that the modified model is applicable to a cross-national group of social media users. Moreover, this study demonstrates the impact of cultural characteristics on various technology adoption constructs in the model.",,,,

However, research highlights a critical disparity in firearm-related deaths by race. Researchers often cite racial bias as a contributing factor for the racial disparity in firearm-related deaths. To provide a foundation for potential social work interventions, the present article discusses the results of an assessment of whether explicit racial biases toward four racial and ethnic groups (white, black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino), fear of crime, and the quantity and quality of interactions with neighbors of a different race are predictors of gun ownership. Findings suggest that explicit racial bias toward black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino individuals is a significant predictor of gun ownership. Fear of crime and more frequent interactions with neighbors of a different race are also significant predictors of gun ownership. Taken as a whole, findings suggest that gun owners are more likely to be more vigilant toward people of color because of stereotypical assumptions that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be involved with crime. Social work practice and policy implications include developing interventions aimed at reducing implicit bias and identifying policies that are associated with lower levels of implicit bias among gun owners.",,,,

However, research highlights a critical disparity in firearm-related deaths by race. Researchers often cite racial bias as a contributing factor for the racial disparity in firearm-related deaths. To provide a foundation for potential social work interventions, the present article discusses the results of an assessment of whether explicit racial biases toward four racial and ethnic groups (white, black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino), fear of crime, and the quantity and quality of interactions with neighbors of a different race are predictors of gun ownership. Findings suggest that explicit racial bias toward black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino individuals is a significant predictor of gun ownership. Fear of crime and more frequent interactions with neighbors of a different race are also significant predictors of gun ownership. Taken as a whole, findings suggest that gun owners are more likely to be more vigilant toward people of color because of stereotypical assumptions that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be involved with crime. Social work practice and policy implications include developing interventions aimed at reducing implicit bias and identifying policies that are associated with lower levels of implicit bias among gun owners.",,,,

The study is based in a mental health literacy framework. This study was completed in a Midwestern metropolitan area with African American and European American, Christian clergy. We used ordinary least squares regression analysis to compare variables' relationships with the amount of time that clergy spent counseling older people. Findings indicate that clergy who are African American, clergy who have more training specific to mental illness, and clergy who are Roman Catholic spend greater percentages of their time counseling older people. Discussion centers on an explanation of results and how best to support clergy in their role as front line providers of supportive counseling services. ",,,,

Reported herein is the synthesis, detailed characterization, and reactivity of a series of Ni(ii) and Ni(iii) metallacycle complexes stabilized by tetradentate pyridinophane ligands with various N-substituents. Interestingly, while the oxidation of the Ni(ii) complexes with various other oxidants led to exclusive C-C bond formation in very good yields, the use of O2 or H2O2 as oxidants led to formation of appreciable amounts of C-O bond formation products, especially for the Ni(ii) complex supported by an asymmetric pyridinophane ligand containing one tosyl N-substituent. Moreover, cryo-ESI-MS studies support the formation of several high-valent Ni species as key intermediates in this uncommon Ni-mediated oxygenase-type chemistry.",cc-by-nc,32110325.0,,PMC6984385

The strategy development was made possible thanks to our enhanced understanding of the reaction mechanism and the modes by which SBiz imidates interact with various promoters of glycosylation.",,28135419.0,"['Imidoesters', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Molecular Structure', 'Glycosylation', 'Models, Molecular']",PMC5498158

In contrast to the extensively studied Pd catalysts that generally employ diamagnetic intermediates, Ni systems can more easily access various oxidation states including odd-electron configurations. For example, organometallic Ni<sup>III</sup> intermediates with aryl and/or alkyl ligands are commonly proposed as the active intermediates in cross-coupling reactions. Herein, we report the first isolated Ni<sup>III</sup>-dialkyl complex and show that this species is involved in stoichiometric and catalytic C-C bond formation reactions. Interestingly, the rate of C-C bond formation from a Ni<sup>III</sup> center is enhanced in the presence of an oxidant, suggesting the involvement of transient Ni<sup>IV</sup> species. Indeed, such a Ni<sup>IV</sup> species was observed and characterized spectroscopically for a nickelacycle system. Overall, these studies suggest that both Ni<sup>III</sup> and Ni<sup>IV</sup> species could play an important role in a range of Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, especially those involving alkyl substrates.",,27599205.0,,

To accomplish this, different theranostic formulations have been evaluated. However, most of them are found to suffer from several limitations extending from poor resolution, radiation damage, to high costs. In order to develop a better theranostic modality, we have designed and synthesized a novel platinum(ii)-based 'aggregation induced emission' (AIE) molecule (named BMPP-Pt) which showed strong intra-cellular fluorescence and also simultaneously exhibited potent cytotoxic activity. Due to this dual functionality, we wanted to explore the possibility of using this compound as a single molecule based theranostic modality. This compound was characterized using elemental analysis, NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray structure determination. BMPP-Pt was found to exhibit a high AIE property with emission maxima at 497 nm. For more efficient cancer cell targeting, BMPP-Pt was encapsulated into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Pt-MSNPs) and the MSNPs were further surface modified with an anti-EpCAM aptamer (Pt-MSNP-E). Pt-MSNPs exhibited higher intracellular fluorescence compared to free BMPP-Pt, though both of them induced a similar degree of cell death via the apoptosis pathway, possibly via cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Anti-EpCAM aptamer modification was found to increase both cytotoxicity and intracellular fluorescence compared to unmodified MSNPs. Our study showed that EpCAM functionalized BMPP-Pt loaded MSNPs can efficiently internalize and induce apoptosis of cancer cells as well as show strong intracellular fluorescence. This study provides clues towards the development of a potential single compound based theranostic modality in future.",cc0,29517794.0,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Platinum', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Drug Carriers', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Porosity', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide', 'Nanoparticles', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Theranostic Nanomedicine']",

 and settlements for large payments and batches for smaller transactions. Using ACH data, this paper calculates the annual opportunity cost of using a real-time model such as blockchain versus ACH's discrete, twice-a-day clearance and settlement procedure. For 2016, the real-time protocol would

Using descriptive statistics, more than 96% of the participants reported they were motivated because of the desire to be healthy. Canonical correlation analysis and conditional random forest were used to determine the importance of individual motivators and barriers. Canonical correlation analysis yielded one interpretable canonical variate that explained 39.5% of the variance in sets of motivators and barriers, and health promotion lifestyle variables. Men with fewer motivators and more barriers took less responsibility for their health, participated in less physical activity, and reported less spiritual growth. Having too many things to do and not knowing what to do best predicted participation in HPBs. ",,,,

Nowhere is this currently more apparent than in the cities of Ferguson and Baltimore. It is not the civil unrest itself, but the resulting rioting and intentional violence that can create a disaster situation. This increases the care burden of health care providers during times when the governmental structure may be overwhelmed or functioning in a less than optimal manner. Beginning with the death of Michael Brown, civil unrest over the last 2 years has necessitated a closer examination of the role nurse leaders play in preparing their staff and facilities for potential results of this civil unrest. The similarities between the results of rioting and violence and natural disaster are obvious, but the differences are significant. Without adequate preparation, providers may not offer the appropriate response.

Established in 2011 after two wars, South Sudan has since reverted to a state of devastating civil strife. This book provides a general history of the new country, from the arrival of Turco-Egyptian explorers in Upper Nile, the turbulence of the Mahdist revolutionary period, the chaos of the 'Scramble for Africa', during which the South was prey to European and African adventurers and empire builders, to the Anglo-Egyptian colonial era. Special attention is paid to the period since Sudanese independence in 1956, when Southern disaffection grew into outright war, from the 1960s to 1972, and from 1983 until the Comprehensive Peace of 2005, and to the transition to South Sudan's independence. The book concludes with coverage of events since then, which since December 2013 have assumed the character of civil war, and with insights into what the future might hold.",,,,

Although the RSCSE has been translated into multiple languages, few studies have examined scale performance across samples. We examine congruence of psychometric, reliability, and validity data to inform research and practice.MethodsWe conducted citation searches using Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. Identified dementia caregiving studies cited the original RSCSE article and described results of English and/or non-English translations of the scale.ResultsPeer-reviewed published studies (N = 58) of dementia family caregivers included data for Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Italian, and Spanish translations of the RSCSE; the majority (72%) reported use of non-English translations. Studies utilizing confirmatory factor analytic approaches reported findings consistent with the original development study. Internal consistency, convergent/discriminant validity, and criterion validity indices were congruent across diverse cross-national caregiving samples assessed with different translations. Data supported the RSCSE’s sensitivity to change following specific psychosocial caregiving interventions.DiscussionThe reliability and validity of different translations of the RSCSE support continued use with cross-national samples of dementia family caregivers. Limitations of the scale point to the need for further self-efficacy measurement development within caregiving domains. Consistent with Bandura’s discussion of social cognitive theory in cultural contexts, personal agency for caregiving challenges remains generalizable to cross-national populations. This review discusses the implications for cross-cultural research and practice.",,,,

This study assesses the impact of NCD diagnosis, while controlling for reported level of cognitive impairment, on family caregiver judgment of driving safety. Method: An intervention sample of 152 intergenerational caregivers who assist an older adult with medical tasks was used. Caregiver’s pre-intervention response to a single item of confidence in the older adult driving was used to determine judgment of driving ability. Cognitive impairment was assessed using caregivers’ report for Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum of Boxes score. Results: Older adults with a diagnosis were rated as less capable of driving safely than those without a diagnosis, while controlling for reported level of cognitive impairment. Conclusion: Results of this study highlight the importance of NCD diagnosis on caregiver judgments. Results of this study have implications for health care and driving safety. ",,,,

This study aimed to investigate the role of self-reassurance and self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts in mitigating the negative effects of caregiving stressors on mental health.Design:Measures were collected during a pre-intervention assessment for a larger study in the U.S.A. evaluating online interventions for intergenerational caregivers. Hierarchical linear regressions were used to examine the contribution of self-reassurance and self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts on mental health outcomes, after controlling for caregiving-related contextual variables and stressors.Setting:Participants completed online questionnaires on a computer or tablet at their convenience.Participants:Participants were 150 help-seeking adult women providing health-care assistance to older relatives living in the community.Measurements:Measures were completed for the mental health outcomes of depression, anxiety, and stress. Measures also included contextual factors of caregiving and demographics. Cognitive impairment, caregiver assistance, role overload, percentage of care provided, family conflict, self-reassurance, and self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts were also measured.Results:Regression models revealed that both self-reassurance and self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts predicted depression, anxiety, and perceived stress after controlling for caregiving contextual factors and stressors.Conclusions:The results indicate that self-reassurance and self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts are effective resources linked to mental health outcomes. Although results were obtained with cross-sectional data, these findings suggest the potential of targeting these resources in transdiagnostic interventions for family caregivers.",,,,

Police Misconduct,2023.0,"[{'given': 'Cohen R', 'family': 'Simpson', 'name': 'Cohen R Simpson'}, {'given': 'David S', 'family': 'Kirk', 'name': 'David S Kirk'}]",Journal of quantitative criminology,10.1007/s10940-021-09532-7,journal-article,0748-4518,J Quant Criminol,J Quant Criminol,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,2,39,425-463,2023-01-01,"['Law', 'Pathology and Forensic Medicine']","<h4>Objectives</h4>Understanding if police malfeasance might be ""contagious"" is vital to identifying efficacious paths to police reform. Accordingly, we investigate whether an officer's propensity to engage in misconduct is associated with her direct, routine interaction with colleagues who have themselves engaged in misbehavior in the past.<h4>Methods</h4>Recognizing the importance of analyzing the actual social networks spanning a police force, we use data on collaborative responses to 1,165,136 ""911"" calls for service by 3475 Dallas Police Department (DPD) officers across 2013 and 2014 to construct daily networks of front-line interaction. And we relate these cooperative networks to <i>reported and formally sanctioned</i> misconduct on the part of the DPD officers during the same time period using repeated-events survival models.<h4>Results</h4>Estimates indicate that the risk of a DPD officer engaging in misconduct is not associated with the disciplined misbehavior of her ad hoc, on-the-scene partners. Rather, a greater risk of misconduct is associated with past misbehavior, officer-specific proneness, the neighborhood context of patrol, and, in some cases, officer race, while departmental tenure is a mitigating factor.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our observational findings-based on data from one large police department in the United States-ultimately suggest that actor-based and ecological explanations of police deviance should not be summarily dismissed in favor of accounts emphasizing negative socialization, where our study design also raises the possibility that results are partly driven by unobserved trait-based variation in the situations that officers find themselves in. All in all, interventions focused on individual officers, including the termination of deviant police, may be fruitful for curtailing police misconduct-where early interventions focused on new offenders may be key to avoiding the escalation of deviance.",cc-by,35039710.0,"['Survival analysis', 'Social Networks', 'Misconduct', 'Police', 'Contagion']",PMC8754082

The authors use neighborhood-level data from the city of Miami to test hypotheses regarding the effect of drug activity and traditional indicators of social disorganization on rates of aggravated assault and robbery. The results show that drug activity has robust effects on violent crime that are independent of other disorganization indicators. The authors also find that drug activity is concentrated in neighborhoods with low rates of immigration, less linguistic isolation and ethnic heterogeneity, and where nondrug accidental deaths are prevalent. The authors find no independent effect of neighborhood racial composition on drug activity or violent crime. The results suggest that future neighborhood-level research on social disorganization and violent crime should devote explicit attention to the disorganizing and violence-producing effects of illicit drug activity.",,,,

We examine one possible collateral consequence of the fear and tension surrounding recent immigration trends, anti-Hispanic hate crime. Drawing on traditional theories of intergroup conflict—and particularly minority threat theory—we hypothesize that recent changes in Hispanic immigration are positively related to hate crimes targeting Hispanics. We find support for this hypothesis in a multivariate state-level panel analysis of anti-Hispanic hate crime from 2000 to 2004. Other predictions, however, are not supported. We conclude that the impact of immigration patterns on hate crime is an important area for continued criminological inquiry and that the notion of cultural threat should receive greater attention as studies of intergroup conflict move beyond the Black—White dichotomy.",,,,

                Background
                Potato is the third most consumed crop in the world. Breeding for traits such as yield, product quality and pathogen resistance are main priorities. Identifying molecular signatures of these and other important traits is important in future breeding efforts. In this study, a progeny population from a cross between a breeding line, SW93–1015, and a cultivar, Désirée, was studied by trait analysis and RNA-seq in order to develop understanding of segregating traits at the molecular level and identify transcripts with expressional correlation to these traits. Transcript markers with predictive value for field performance applicable under controlled environments would be of great value for plant breeding.
              
                Results
                A total of 34 progeny lines from SW93–1015 and Désirée were phenotyped for 17 different traits in a field in Nordic climate conditions and controlled climate settings. A master transcriptome was constructed with all 34 progeny lines and the parents through a de novo assembly of RNA-seq reads. Gene expression data obtained in a controlled environment from the 34 lines was correlated to traits by different similarity indices, including Pearson and Spearman, as well as DUO, which calculates the co-occurrence between high and low values for gene expression and trait. Our study linked transcripts to traits such as yield, growth rate, high laying tubers, late and tuber blight, tuber greening and early flowering. We found several transcripts associated to late blight resistance and transcripts encoding receptors were associated to Dickeya solani susceptibility. Transcript levels of a UBX-domain protein was negatively associated to yield and a GLABRA2 expression modulator was negatively associated to growth rate.
              
                Conclusion
                In our study, we identify 100’s of transcripts, putatively linked based on expression with 17 traits of potato, representing both well-known and novel associations. This approach can be used to link the transcriptome to traits. We explore the possibility of associating the level of transcript expression from controlled, optimal environments to traits in a progeny population with different methods introducing the application of DUO for the first time on transcriptome data. We verify the expression pattern for five of the putative transcript markers in another progeny population.

Here we report a remarkable yin-yang haplotype pattern encompassing gephyrin. Yin-yang haplotypes arise when a stretch of DNA evolves to present two disparate forms that bear differing states for nucleotide variations along their lengths. The gephyrin yin-yang pair consists of 284 divergent nucleotide states and both variants vary drastically from their mutual ancestral haplotype, suggesting rapid evolution. Several independent lines of evidence indicate strong positive selection on the region and suggest these high-frequency haplotypes represent two distinct functional mechanisms.

We performed plasma deep proteomic profiling from 332 COVID-19 patients and 150 controls and pursued replication in an independent cohort (297 cases and 76 controls) to find potential biomarkers and causal proteins for three COVID-19 outcomes (infection, ventilation, and death). We identified and replicated 1,449 proteins associated with any of the three outcomes (841 for infection, 833 for ventilation, and 253 for death) that can be query on a web portal (https://covid.proteomics.wustl.edu/). Using those proteins and machine learning approached we created and validated specific prediction models for ventilation (AUC&gt;0.91), death (AUC&gt;0.95) and either outcome (AUC&gt;0.80). These proteins were also enriched in specific biological processes, including immune and cytokine signaling (FDR ≤ 3.72×10-14), Alzheimer’s disease (FDR ≤ 5.46×10-10) and coronary artery disease (FDR ≤ 4.64×10-2). Mendelian randomization using pQTL as instrumental variants nominated BCAT2 and GOLM1 as a causal proteins for COVID-19. Causal gene network analyses identified 141 highly connected key proteins, of which 35 have known drug targets with FDA-approved compounds. Our findings provide distinctive prognostic biomarkers for two severe COVID-19 outcomes (ventilation and death), reveal their relationship to Alzheimer’s disease and coronary artery disease, and identify potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19 outcomes.",,,,

Discovery of biomarkers to diagnose specific subtypes within a heterogeneous diseased population is a key step towards realizing the benefits of precision medicine. However, popular statistical methods for evaluating candidate biomarkers – fold change (FC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) – were designed for homogeneous data. Herein, we evaluate the performance of these metrics in heterogeneous populations. Using simulated biomarkers that are nearly ‘ideal’ for distinguishing subgroups of various proportions of the diseased population, we observe that AUC misses all up to subset size of 50% and FC misses all biomarkers entirely. We introduce a simple new measure to address this shortfall and run a series of trials comprised of simulated and biological data to demonstrate its utility for evaluating biomarkers associated with disease subtypes.",,,,

First, we suggest characteristics that a conceptual framework ought to exhibit. Most of these suggestions are based on our critique of the existing framework and the FASB-IASB work in progress. Second, we present a model framework that exhibits these characteristics. We emphasize up front that this framework is quite explicit. It goes to the heart of what a framework document should do: it places specific restrictions on what constitutes admissible accounting standards. The purpose of our effort is to stimulate broad discussion of alternative approaches to foundational documents and to offer a specific example of such an alternative approach.",,,,

As maintained by feminist theorists, due to the possibility of perpetuating or increasing violent behaviors within a couple, a conjoint treatment for IPV is generally contraindicated. However, multiple studies have shown that conjoint approaches do not increase the risk of harm to the victim. Following a thorough assessment of the dynamics of violence within a relationship, individual personality patterns, and adequate counselor training in IPV, a conjoint approach may be beneficial to reduce violent behaviors while increasing communication, problem-solving skills, and overall relationship satisfaction.

               “Life without Empire: Audiencia Ministers after Independence” draws upon sources from Spain’s national, regional, and university archives to examine men with audiencia positions in Spain and in the Indies from the end of the sale of appointments in 1750 to 1821. In 1750 these ministers shared backgrounds of gender and university study of civil law, canon law, or both. They differed in regard to place of birth, the purchase of an initial audiencia appointment, age at first appointment, educational experience and university affiliation, prior government service and university teaching, and the extent of prominent letrado relatives serving audiencias, chancellories, and councils. By 1808 these differences had largely disappeared and a much more homogenous corps of ministers served on the tribunals. The changes in background facilitated the incorporation into the Spanish courts of a substantial number of ministers with American service after independence. Many creole and the few peninsular ministers who remained in the Americas after independence also obtained positions there. Compared to intendants and bishops in the Americas, ministers on New World audiencias proved relatively successful in securing posts after independence. In terms of subsequent offices held, the handful of creole audiencia ministers that emigrated to Spain fared better than the peninsulars that remained in the newly independent states.",,,,

We recently projected a $1.03 billion annual benefit to the U.S. golf industry from the USGA's investment in the three areas of water, fertilizer, and pesticide management research. However, the effort also has improved putting green construction techniques (PGCT), encouraged the incorporation of naturalized roughs (NR), and improved turfgrass cultivars (ITC). Our objective was to estimate the golf industry's financial benefit from the USGA's investment in these additional three areas. Data were collected from an online survey focused on the benefits associated with golf facilities’ adoption of research‐based management practices. Multiple econometric models were developed for PGCT, NR, and ITC that used data from the survey. All three research areas have been widely adopted throughout the U.S. golf industry. Across the three areas studied, modeling indicated a total annual financial benefit of $886.9 million to the golf industry. Further, the total annual financial benefit from all six areas is $1.92 billion. Compared with an estimated yearly Green Section budget of roughly $10 million, this is a healthy return on the USGA's investment and demonstrates the importance of research investment to the sustainability of the golf industry.",cc-by-nc-4.0,,,

This effort has developed research‐based management practices that have contributed to the efficient use of water, fertilizer, and pesticides on U.S. golf courses. Still, there is insufficient evidence of the economic benefits. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the golf industry's resource and economic benefits from the USGA's investment in water, fertilizer, and pesticide management research. Data were collected from an online survey focused on the benefits associated with golf facilities’ adoption of research‐based management practices in six primary areas of interest: (a) evapotranspiration‐based irrigation scheduling (water budgeting), (b) soil moisture sensing, (c) best management practices that reduce nonpoint source pollution by fertilizers and pesticides, (d) putting green construction techniques, (e) naturalized roughs, and (f) improved turfgrass cultivars. Only the first three areas are discussed in this study. Based on data from the survey, multiple econometric models were developed for each of the management practices. All three research‐based management practices have been widely adopted throughout the U.S. golf industry. Across the three management practices studied, modeling indicated a total annual financial benefit of US$1.03 billion to the golf industry. This compares with an estimated yearly Green Section budget of roughly US$10 million, of which US$2 million is for turfgrass and environmental research. Research investment by governments and industry leaders is critical to the sustainability of the golf industry.",,,,

Gifts and frauds are also common. Although the rationality perspective has dominated and made important contributions to the study of drug transfer, this article proposes a new theory of drug sales, gifts, and frauds. The theoretical lens of pure sociology is used to find social structural patterns in qualitative data obtained from a study of middle- and lower class drug dealers. Based on that data, the authors suggest that the social status of drug procurers and their social distance from drug dealers affect (a) whether the transfer is a gift, sale, or fraud and (b) the size of the gift, the price of the sale, and the seriousness of the fraud. Implications for future research are discussed. ",,,,

The comprehensive dataset included all reported field-free, gas phase spectroscopic data for PtS, including 32 Fourier transform microwave transitions (estimated accuracy: 1 kHz), 9 microwave/optical double resonance transitions (25 kHz), 51 millimeter and submillimeter transitions (25–50 kHz), 469 molecular beam-laser induced fluorescence transitions (0.003 cm−1), and 4870 ILS transitions (0.005 cm−1). The determined equilibrium constants have been used with the Rydberg-Klein-Rees method to produce potential energy curves for the four known electronic states of PtS. Isotopic shifts in electronic transition energy beyond expectations from the Born-Oppenheimer approximation were observed and treated as electronic field-shift effects due to the difference in the nuclear charge radius between Pt isotopes.

Phylogenetic patterns in these attributes provide insight into the extent to which rarity and extinction risk are conserved during evolution and the potential for species‐level heritability. We evaluated phylogenetic signal (i.e., related species resembling each other more than species drawn at random) and evolutionary conservatism (similarity among related species exceeding that expected from a Brownian model of evolution) in three axes of rarity (local abundance, geographical range size and habitat breadth) among species in a regional pool of tropical woody plants.LocationThe Madidi region in Bolivia.Time period2001–2010.Major taxa studiedLignophyta clade.MethodsWe used a network of 48 1‐ha forest plots and 442 0.1‐ha forest plots to measure local abundance and habitat breadth of 1,700+ woody plant species (from 100+ plant families). We estimated geographical range size from occurrence records of individual species across the Neotropics. We characterized overall phylogenetic patterns of rarity using Blomberg's K and applied variance partitioning among taxonomic levels, as well as disparity analysis, to describe patterns of trait distribution at different depths in the phylogeny.ResultsWe found phylogenetic signal, but not evolutionary conservatism, in the three axes of rarity. The variance in rarity among supra‐specific taxa, particularly families and genera, exceeded that calculated from random draws of species from the Madidi region. Phylogenetic signal, estimated by the proportion of variance among supra‐specific taxonomic levels, varied between 23 and 36% for local abundance and geographical range size, and between 9 and 10% for habitat breadth.Main conclusionsThe regional pool of woody plant species in Madidi exhibits phylogenetic signal in rarity that is consistent with biologically significant species‐level heritability.",,,,

          Phylogenetic diversity is a measure of biodiversity that incorporates both the number of species and their evolutionary histories. Comparisons of biodiversity between regions that are currently ecologically similar but support different numbers of species are informed by considering differences in their geographic and evolutionary histories. Here we analyze diversity in numerous floras distributed across eastern Asia and eastern North America, and find that phylogenetic diversity in eastern Asia substantially exceeds that in eastern North America when controlling statistically for climate and species richness. This difference parallels the more complex history and geography of the Asian continent.",,,,

          Within eastern North America, distributions of vector-transmitted haemosporidian blood parasites of birds, commonly known as “avian malaria parasites,” are associated with the distributions of their host species independently of direct effects of climate on potential vectors. Spatial analyses additionally indicated an absence of dispersal limitation for these parasites. Finally, host-breadth, ranging continuously from specialist to generalist, varies among parasite lineages and is dynamic within parasite assemblages over space and time. The distributions of avian haemosporidian parasites emphasize the ability of parasites to disperse across broad regions and to switch readily between hosts to become emerging infectious diseases.",,,,

Specifically, we investigate how the feeding patterns of Culex mosquito vectors relate to distributions of avian malaria parasites among hosts in suburban Chicago, IL, USA. We show that Plasmodium lineages, defined by cytochrome b haplotypes, are heterogeneously distributed across avian hosts. However, the feeding patterns of the dominant vectors (Culex restuans and Culex pipiens) are similar across these hosts, and do not explain the distributions of Plasmodium parasites. Phylogenetic similarity of avian hosts predicts similarity in their Plasmodium parasites. This effect was driven primarily by the general association of Plasmodium parasites with particular host superfamilies.

With the increasing availability of data on distributions and phylogenetic relationships and new analytical approaches to understanding the processes that shape species distributions and interactions, a re‐evaluation of this ever‐interesting topic is timely.LocationIslands globally.MethodsWe start by arguing that the reasons why island research has achieved so much in the past also apply to the future. We then critically assess the current state of island biogeography, focusing on recent changes in emphasis, including research featured in this special issue of Global Ecology and Biogeography. Finally, we suggest promising themes for the future. We cover both ecological and evolutionary topics, although the greater emphasis on island ecology reflects our own backgrounds and interests.ResultsMuch ecological theory has been directly or indirectly influenced by research on island biotas. Currently, island biogeography is renascent, with research focusing on, among other things, patterns and processes underlying species interaction networks, species coexistence and the assembly of island communities through ecological and evolutionary time. Continuing island research should provide additional insight into biological invasions and other impacts of human activities, functional diversity and ecosystem functioning, extinction and diversification, species pools and more. Deeper understanding of the similarities and differences between island and mainland systems will aid transferability of island theory to continental regions.Main conclusionsAs research in biogeography and related fields expands in new directions, islands continue to provide opportunities for developing insights, both as natural laboratories for ecology and evolution and because of the exceptions islands often present to the usual ‘rules’ of ecology. New data collection initiatives are needed on islands world‐wide and should be directed towards filling gaps in our knowledge of within‐island distributions of species, as well as the functional traits and phylogenetic relationships of island species.",,,,

Despite their ubiquity, the ecological and evolutionary factors that shape the diversity and distribution of these protozoan parasites among avian communities and geographic regions are poorly understood. Based on a survey throughout the Neotropics of the haemosporidian parasites infecting manakins (Pipridae), a family of Passerine birds endemic to this region, we asked whether host relatedness, ecological similarity and geographic proximity structure parasite turnover between manakin species and local manakin assemblages. We used molecular methods to screen 1343 individuals of 30 manakin species for the presence of parasites. We found no significant correlations between manakin parasite lineage turnover and both manakin species turnover and geographic distance. Climate differences, species turnover in the larger bird community and parasite lineage turnover in non-manakin hosts did not correlate with manakin parasite lineage turnover. We also found no evidence that manakin parasite lineage turnover among host species correlates with range overlap and genetic divergence among hosts. Our analyses indicate that host switching (turnover among host species) and dispersal (turnover among locations) of haemosporidian parasites in manakins are not constrained at this scale.",,,,

          To study long-term changes in ecological assemblages in the absence of a fossil record, we take advantage of the joining and separation of islands on shallow banks in the West Indies archipelago caused by glacial-cycle sea-level changes. We compare pairs of assemblages of avian malaria parasites on islands that were connected during periods of low sea levels and subsequently isolated about 2.5 ka with assemblages on islands that were never connected, as well as assemblages sampled over local scales of time and space on a single island. This approach reveals millennial-scale change in the prevalence of parasite lineages followed by lineage replacement over longer periods, providing unique access to long-term change.",,,,

Traditionally, ecologists have held that the pervasive relationship between species richness and conditions of the physical environment reflects the influence of environment on the ability of populations to coexist locally. However, many ecologists now recognize that this relationship can also develop historically from the evolutionary diversification of lineages within and between ecological zones. To assess the relative roles of local ecological constraint vs. regional and historical unfolding of diversity-environment relationships, we must abandon localized concepts of the community and adopt historical (particularly phylogenetic) and geographic methods to evaluate the evolution of diversity within large regions and its influence on diversity at local scales.

Similarities between islands with respect to geographical distance, avian host assemblages and haemosporidian parasite assemblages were compared by partial Mantel tests. Relative abundances of avian host populations across islands were compared to the relative abundances of common haemosporidian lineages by stepwise regression.ResultsPopulations of parasite lineages were more heterogeneously distributed than were host populations across the islands; parasite lineages frequently shift between hosts on different islands and exhibit range disjunctions. Relative population sizes of two widespread and common species of bird in the Lesser Antilles, the bananaquit Coereba flaveola and the black‐faced grassquit Tiaris bicolor, were negatively related to the relative abundances of two parasite lineages, OZ01 (Plasmodium sp.) and OZ12 (Haemoproteus sp.), although the latter parasite was not recovered from either host. Positive associations between populations of Elaenia martinica and the relative abundance of three parasite lineages in populations of Vireo altiloquus additionally suggest the possibility of apparent competition between avian species mediated through haemosporidian parasites.Main conclusionsThe results of these analyses are consistent with a strong influence of some avian haemosporidian parasites on populations of their hosts, including indirect interactions through apparent competition.

          The number of species in local ecological assemblages is constrained by competition and other local interactions between populations. However, ecologists have not agreed on the degree to which the unique history and geography of continental regions also influence local species richness. Here, based on forest plots distributed throughout the world, we show that the species richness of forest trees varies among continental regions independently of local climate. In particular, forest plots in Europe and North America contain fewer species than expected from the statistical relationship of diversity to present-day local climate. Thus, the number of species co-occurring locally reflects, to a significant extent, region characteristics, including geographic and geologic history, that influence evolutionary diversification and regional extinction.",,,,

Hosts of specialist malaria parasite lineages were on average more abundant than hosts of generalist parasite lineages, but the relationship between host abundance and parasite specialization was not consistent across analyses. We also found support for a positive association between parasite specialization and host longevity, but this also was not consistent across analyses. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that the predictability of a host resource may play a role in the evolution of specialization. However, we also discuss two alternative explanations to the resource predictability hypothesis for specialization: (i) that interspecific interactions among the parasites themselves might constrain some parasites to a specialist strategy, and (ii) that frequent encounters with multiple host species, mediated by blood‐sucking insects, might promote generalization within this system.",,,,

               Solitaires (Myadestes spp.) are montane-forest birds that are widely distributed throughout the New World, ranging from Alaska to northern Bolivia and including both Hawaii and the West Indies. To understand the origins of this impressive distribution, we used five mitochondrial gene sequences to reconstruct the historical biogeography of the genus. The resulting phylogeny indicates a rapid initial spread of the genus to occupy most of its contemporary continental range at least as far south as lower Mesoamerica, plus Hawaii and the Greater Antilles. The North American M. townsendi appears to be the sister taxon of the rest of Myadestes. Myadestes obscurus of Hawaii is more closely allied to Mesoamerican lineages than to M. townsendi. The strongly supported sister relationship of the two West Indian taxa, M. elisabeth and M. genibarbis, indicates a single colonization of the West Indies. A more recent node links the Andean M. ralloides to the Mesoamerican M. melanops and M. coloratus. A standard molecular clock calibration of 2% sequence divergence per million years for avian mitochondrial DNA suggests that the initial diversification of Myadestes occurred near the end of the Miocene (between 5 and 7.5 mya). Cooler temperatures and lower sea levels at that time would have increased the extent of montane forests and reduced overwater dispersal distances, possibly favoring range expansion and colonization of the West Indies. The split between South American and southern Mesoamerican lineages dates to ∼3 mya, which suggests that Myadestes expanded its range to South America soon after the Pliocene rise of the Isthmus of Panama. Despite the demonstrated capacity of Myadestes for long-distance dispersal, several species of Myadestes are highly differentiated geographically. Phylogeographic structure was greatest in the West Indian M. genibarbis, which occurs on several islands in the Greater Antilles and Lesser Antilles, and in the Andean M. ralloides. The phylogeographic differentiation within M. ralloides was not anticipated by previous taxonomic treatments and provides a further example of the importance of the Andes in the diversification of Neotropical birds. Overall, the historical biogeography of Myadestes suggests that range expansion and long-distance dispersal are transient population phases followed by persistent phases of population differentiation and limited dispersal.

In this study, we test this prediction by analysing a comprehensive dataset of forest communities that covers all forest biomes across the world. Furthermore, within a forest community, vegetation layers from understorey to canopy could be considered a gradient of biotic interaction, on one hand, and an environmental gradient, on the other hand. We assess trends of phylogenetic relatedness of tree species across strata of forests in different forest biomes across the world. LOCATION: Global. METHOD: We analysed 186 forest plots, each being 0.1 ha in size. For each forest plot, we divided stems into three stem‐size classes. Net relatedness index (NRI) and nearest taxon index (NTI) for angiosperm woody plant assemblages were calculated for each forest plot and for each stem‐size class of the plot. NRI and NTI of forest plots were related to temperature and precipitation in the framework of Whittaker's biome system. RESULTS: When both deep and shallow evolutionary histories of woody species were considered, angiosperm woody plants tended to be more closely related in colder and/or drier climates. Phylogenetic relatedness was greater (i.e. more phylogenetic clustering) among trees with larger stems than among trees with smaller stems at the global scale. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that species are more closely related towards colder and/or dryer biomes is consistent with the prediction of the TNC hypothesis. The pattern of increasing phylogenetic relatedness towards the upper canopy layer of a forest is stronger in temperate compared to tropical regions, suggesting stronger environmental filtering in the more stressful canopy environment.",,,,

The failure of ecology to fully integrate the diversity issue into its core of accepted wisdom derives from an inappropriate concept of community and the rejection of history and region as formative contexts for ecological systems. Traditionally, ecologists have held that the pervasive relationship between species richness and conditions of the physical environment reflects the influence of environment on the ability of populations to coexist locally. However, many ecologists now recognize that this relationship can also develop historically from the evolutionary diversification of lineages within and between ecological zones. To assess the relative roles of local ecological constraint vs. regional and historical unfolding of diversity-environment relationships, we must abandon localized concepts of the community and adopt historical (particularly phylogenetic) and geographic methods to evaluate the evolution of diversity within large regions and its influence on diversity at local scales. This integrated perspective opens new research directions for ecologists to explore the formation of species, adaptive diversification, and the adjustment of ecological distributions of species on regional scales.",,16922298.0,"['Animals', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Ecosystem', 'Biodiversity', 'Geography', 'Genetic Speciation', 'Biological Evolution']",

Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research.",,,,

In this study, we asked whether two common avian blood parasites, one haemosporidian and one trypanosome, affect each other's occurrence in individuals of a single host species. We used molecular genotyping to survey protozoan parasites in the peripheral blood of yellow-breasted chats (Aves: Passeriformes [Parulidae]:Icteria virens) from the Ozarks of Southern Missouri. We also determined whether single and co-infections differently influence white blood cell and polychromatic erythrocyte counts, the latter being a measure of regenerative anaemia. We found a positive association between the haemosporidian and trypanosome parasites, such that infection by one increases the probability that an individual host is infected by the other. Adult individuals were more likely than juveniles to exhibit haemosporidian infection, but co-infections and single trypanosome infections were not age-related. We found evidence of pathogenicity of trypanosomes in that infected individuals exhibited similar levels of regenerative anaemia as birds infected with haemosporidian parasites of the genusPlasmodium.

There is, as of yet, shockingly little philosophical literature explicitly aiming to answer this question. This essay sketches some of the logical space of possible answers, and nudges us to seriously consider certain overlooked options. There are several importantly different ways the well-being of a collective or a group could be related to the well-being of the individuals who constitute it: 1) eliminativism, 2) functionalism, 3) partialism, or 4) the independent view. If the relation between individual and collective well-being is either functional or partial, then we face a further question: What is the direction of constitutive dependence?  Does the well-being of a group depend upon the well-being of the well-being of the individuals who compose it, or does the well-being of an individual depend upon the well-being of the groups to which they belong?  Or both?  These questions raise some puzzles that I begin to resolve.  I conclude that there might be a wide variety of ways the well-being of a collective obtains, only some of which are related to the well-being of the individuals who are its members.  In the end, I hope to vindicate the thought that an injury to one is an injury to all.",cc-by-nc-nd-4.0,,,

This chapter, however, argues that moral advice differs from moral testimony, differs from it in a way that enables a defender of moral advice to parry this worry about moral worth. The basic idea is that an advisor and an advisee can together constitute a joint agent, and that this joint agent’s action can indeed have moral worth. So while the advisee himself might not do the right thing for the right reason (this because all alone he lacks the right reason), and while the advisor herself might not do the right thing for the right reason (this because all alone she does not do the right thing), they together do the right thing for the right reason.",,,,

                  Background
                  Penguins (Sphenisciformes) are a remarkable order of flightless wing-propelled diving seabirds distributed widely across the southern hemisphere. They share a volant common ancestor with Procellariiformes close to the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (66 million years ago) and subsequently lost the ability to fly but enhanced their diving capabilities. With ∼20 species among 6 genera, penguins range from the tropical Galápagos Islands to the oceanic temperate forests of New Zealand, the rocky coastlines of the sub-Antarctic islands, and the sea ice around Antarctica. To inhabit such diverse and extreme environments, penguins evolved many physiological and morphological adaptations. However, they are also highly sensitive to climate change. Therefore, penguins provide an exciting target system for understanding the evolutionary processes of speciation, adaptation, and demography. Genomic data are an emerging resource for addressing questions about such processes.
               
               
                  Results
                  Here we present a novel dataset of 19 high-coverage genomes that, together with 2 previously published genomes, encompass all extant penguin species. We also present a well-supported phylogeny to clarify the relationships among penguins. In contrast to recent studies, our results demonstrate that the genus Aptenodytes is basal and sister to all other extant penguin genera, providing intriguing new insights into the adaptation of penguins to Antarctica. As such, our dataset provides a novel resource for understanding the evolutionary history of penguins as a clade, as well as the fine-scale relationships of individual penguin lineages. Against this background, we introduce a major consortium of international scientists dedicated to studying these genomes. Moreover, we highlight emerging issues regarding ensuring legal and respectful indigenous consultation, particularly for genomic data originating from New Zealand Taonga species.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  We believe that our dataset and project will be important for understanding evolution, increasing cultural heritage and guiding the conservation of this iconic southern hemisphere species assemblage.

Two commonly occurring species, Ae. taeniorhynchus and Cx. quinquefasciatus, were collected along with environmental variables characteristic of the trapping sites to assess their influence on mosquito abundance and occurrence in the dry season of 2015. We captured Ae. taeniorhynchus at 14 out of 18 sites and Cx. quinquefasciatus at low and high elevation sites on Santa Cruz. We utilized two generalized linear models; the first assessed the influence of environmental variables on abundances of Ae. taeniorhynchus and the second assessed the influence of these variables on the presence of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Populations of both mosquito species declined with elevation. Rainfall data were limited, as we sampled during the dry season of 2015. Distance to mangroves and maximum humidity were significant in influencing the abundance of Ae. taeniorhynchus, while maximum humidity was found to significantly influence the presence of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Both species occurred in sites where temperature, precipitation, and humidity should allow for mosquito development as well as parasitic development of the protozoan parasites that cause avian malaria.

            Although rare among existing birds, the loss of flight appears to have occurred multiple
times in evolutionary history. However, the genetic changes that ground avian species
are not well understood. Burga
            et al
            . sequenced genomes from three
cormorant species and compared them with that of the flightless Galapagos cormorant (see
the Perspective by Cooper). They identified variants in genes involved in primary
ciliogenesis. Functional analyses of these variants suggest that the impaired function
of the genes may be responsible for skeletal changes associated with the Galapagos
cormorant’s loss of flight.

In contrast to recent studies, our results demonstrate that the genus Aptenodytes is basal and sister to all other extant penguin genera, providing intriguing new insights into the adaptation of penguins to Antarctica. As such, our dataset provides a novel resource for understanding the evolutionary history of penguins as a clade, as well as the fine-scale relationships of individual penguin lineages. Against this background, we introduce a major consortium of international scientists dedicated to studying these genomes. Moreover, we highlight emerging issues regarding ensuring legal and respectful indigenous consultation, particularly for genomic data originating from New Zealand Taonga species.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  We believe that our dataset and project will be important for understanding evolution, increasing cultural heritage and guiding the conservation of this iconic southern hemisphere species assemblage.

In nature, multiparasitic infections of primates usually fluctuate temporally and seasonally, implying that the acquisition of reliable data must occur over time. Individual parasite infection data from two wild populations of New World primates, the saddleback (Leontocebus weddelli) and emperor (Saguinus imperator) tamarin, were collected over 3 years to establish baseline levels of helminth prevalence and parasite species richness (PSR). Secondarily, we explored variation in parasite prevalence across age and sex classes, test nonrandom associations of parasite co-occurrence, and assess the relationship between group size and PSR. From 288 fecal samples across 105 individuals (71 saddleback and 34 emperor tamarins), 10 parasite taxa were identified by light microscopy following centrifugation and ethyl-acetate sedimentation. Of these taxa, none were host-specific, Dicrocoeliidae and Cestoda prevalences differed between host species, Prosthenorchis and Strongylida were the most prevalent. Host age was positively associated with Prosthenorchis ova and filariform larva, but negatively with cestode and the Rhabditoidea ova. We detected no differences between expected and observed levels of co-infection, nor between group size and parasite species richness over 30 group-years. Logistic models of individual infection status did not identify a sex bias; however, age and species predicted the presence of four and three parasite taxa, respectively, with saddleback tamarins exhibiting higher PSR.

Research on the feeding behavior of mosquitoes can provide clues to the hosts and vectors involved in disease transmission. This information is particularly critical for endemic wildlife fauna in island systems that have evolved without resistance to novel diseases such as avian malaria. The aims of this study were to determine the blood-feeding patterns of two species of mosquitoes found in Galápagos and discuss how their feeding behavior may influence the transmission of pathogens such as avian malaria.<h4>Methods</h4>In the summer of 2015, we sampled two mosquito species (Aedes taeniorhynchus and Culex quinquefasciatus) across 18 different sites on Isla Santa Cruz, which is the second largest island in Galápagos and has the largest human population. We trapped mosquitoes using CDC light traps and CDC gravid traps and identified sources of blood meals for engorged mosquitoes by sequencing a portion of the vertebrate mitochondrial cytochrome b gene.<h4>Results</h4>Out of 947 female mosquitoes captured, 320 were blood-fed, and PCR amplifications were successful for 301 of the blood meals. Results revealed that both Aedes taeniorhynchus and Culex quinquefasciatus feed from a variety of vertebrate taxa, numerically dominated by humans on Isla Santa Cruz.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The high proportion of mammalian blood meals could represent locally available and abundant hosts on Santa Cruz. However, host surveys and estimates of relative abundances of vertebrate species will need to accompany mosquito trapping studies on non-inhabited and inhabited islands in Galápagos to further validate this.",cc-by,31842984.0,"['Culex', 'Aedes', 'Mosquito', 'Feeding Patterns', 'Galápagos', 'Santa Cruz', 'Animals', 'Mammals', 'Humans', 'Cytochromes b', 'Enzymes', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Entomology', 'Ecuador', 'Genotyping Techniques', 'Mosquito Vectors']",PMC6915994

In addition to the direct damage they may cause, they may also bring novel diseases and parasites and/or have the capacity to vector microorganisms that are already established in the ecosystem and are causing harm. Damage caused by ectoparasitic larvae of the invasive fly, Philornis downsi (Dodge and Aitken) to nestlings of endemic birds in the Galapagos Islands is well documented, but nothing is known about whether this fly is itself associated with parasites or pathogens. In this study, diagnostic molecular methods indicated the presence of insect trypanosomatids in P. downsi; to our knowledge, this is the first record of insect trypanosomatids associated with Philornis species. Phylogenetic estimates and evolutionary distances indicate these species are most closely related to the Crithidia and Blastocrithidia genera, which are not currently reported in the Galapagos Islands. The prevalence of trypanosomatids indicates either P. downsi arrived with its own parasites or that it is a highly suitable host for trypanosomatids already found in the Galapagos Islands, or both.

Using genomes, we investigated the drivers of penguin diversification. We found that crown-group penguins diverged in the early Miocene in Australia/New Zealand and identifiedAptenodytes(emperor and king penguins) as the sister group to all other extant penguins. Penguins first occupied temperate environments and then radiated to cold Antarctic waters. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current’s (ACC) intensification 11.6 Mya promoted penguin diversification and geographic expansion. We detected interspecies introgression among penguins, in some cases following the direction of the ACC, and identified genes acting on thermoregulation, oxygen metabolism, and diving capacity that underwent adaptive evolution as they progressively occupied more challenging thermal niches.",cc-by,,,

Our aim was to characterize the geographic origins of two Plasmodium parasite lineages detected in the Galapagos Islands and in North American breeding bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) that regularly stop in Galapagos during migration to their South American overwintering sites. We used samples from a grassland breeding bird assemblage in Nebraska, United States, and parasite DNA sequences from the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, to compare to global data in a DNA sequence registry. Homologous DNA sequences from parasites detected in bobolinks and more sedentary birds (e.g., brown-headed cowbirds Molothrus ater, and other co-occurring bird species resident on the North American breeding grounds) were compared to those recovered in previous studies from global sites. One parasite lineage that matched between Galapagos birds and the migratory bobolink, Plasmodium lineage B, was the most common lineage detected in the global MalAvi database, matching 49 sequences from unique host/site combinations, 41 of which were of South American origin. We did not detect lineage B in brown-headed cowbirds. The other Galapagos-bobolink match, Plasmodium lineage C, was identical to two other sequences from birds sampled in California. We detected a close variant of lineage C in brown-headed cowbirds. Taken together, this pattern suggests that bobolinks became infected with lineage B on the South American end of their migratory range, and with lineage C on the North American breeding grounds. Overall, we detected more parasite lineages in bobolinks than in cowbirds. Galapagos Plasmodium had similar host breadth compared to the non-Galapagos haemosporidian lineages detected in bobolinks, brown-headed cowbirds, and other grassland species. This study highlights the utility of global haemosporidian data in the context of migratory bird-parasite connectivity. It is possible that migratory bobolinks bring parasites to the Galapagos and that these parasites originate from different biogeographic regions representing both their breeding and overwintering sites.",cc-by,26865960.0,"['Plasmodium', 'Migration', 'Host Breadth', 'Haemosporidian Parasites', 'Dolichonyx Oryzivorus', 'Molothrus Ater', 'Galapagos Islands']",PMC4739572

In this study, we analyze the effect of host species identity and the immediate local species assemblage within mixed species colonies of nesting seabirds on patterns of genetic clustering within two species of multihost ectoparasitic lice. We use three genetic markers (one mitochondrial, COI, and two nuclear, EF1-α and wingless) and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees to test whether (1) parasites show lineage sorting based on their host species; and (2) switching of lineages to the alternate host species depends on the immediate local species assemblage of individual hosts within a colony. Specifically, we examine the genetic structure of two louse species: Eidmanniella albescens, infecting both Nazca (Sula granti) and blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii), and Fregatiella aurifasciata, infecting both great (Fregata minor) and magnificent frigatebirds (Fregata magnificens). We found that host species identity was the only factor explaining the patterns of genetic structure in both parasites. In both cases, there is evident genetic differentiation depending on the host species. Thus, a revision of the taxonomy of these louse species is needed. One possible explanation of this pattern is extremely low louse migration rates between host species, perhaps influenced by fine-scale spatial separation of host species within mixed colonies, and low parasite infrapopulation numbers.",cc-by,26380662.0,"['parasites', 'Seabirds', 'Chewing Lice', 'Lineage Sorting', 'Cryptic Speciation']",PMC4569024

	  A meta-theology makes claims about the structure of theological claims: it identifies a single, fundamental claim about God, and shows how other theological claims are derivable from the fundamental claim. In his book Depicting Deity and other articles, Jon Kvanvig has identified three distinct meta-theologies: Creator Theology, Perfect Being Theology, and Worship-worthiness Theology. In this article, we argue that the medieval Islamic philosopher Avicenna's views about God have the structure of a meta-theology, and that it is distinct from the three projects Kvanvig identifies. This view is Necessary Existent Theology.",cc-by-4.0,,,

For oviparous species, mothers can mitigate their reproductive success in at least three ways: (1) by avoiding nest sites with high predation or parasitism risks, (2) through hormonal maternal effects that developmentally prime offspring for survival in risky environments, or (3) by investing less in reproduction when predation or parasitism risks are high. Here, we tested if perceived predation and parasitism risks can induce any of these behavioral or physiological responses by exposing female red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) to playbacks of two major nest threats, a predator (Cooper's hawk, Accipiter cooperii) and an obligate brood parasite (brown-headed cowbird; Molothrus ater), as well as two controls (harmless Eastern meadowlark, Sturnella magna; and silence). We found that female blackbirds did not avoid nesting at sites treated with predator or brood parasite playbacks, nor were females more likely to abandon nesting attempts at these sites. Egg size and yolk hormone profiles, which are common proxies for maternal investment in oviparous species, were statistically similar across treatment sites. Instead, we found intraclutch variation in yolk steroid hormone profiles: concentrations of three progestogens (pregnanedione, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, and deoxycorticosterone) and two androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) were higher in third-laid than first-laid eggs. Our study largely confirms previous findings of consistent intraclutch yolk hormone variation in this species, in birds in general, and in other oviparous lineages, but uniquely reports on several yolk steroid hormones largely overlooked in the literature on hormone-mediated maternal effects.",,37247827.0,"['Predation risk', 'Maternal Effects', 'Yolk Steroids', 'Maternal Hormones', 'Red-winged Blackbird', 'Brood Parasitism Risk', 'Animals', 'Passeriformes', 'Songbirds', 'Parasites', 'Testosterone', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Nesting Behavior', 'Female', 'Male', 'Maternal Inheritance']",

Specifically, a Nernstian gain term is introduced for the constant fuel utilization condition, and it is shown that the Nernstian gain is an irreversibility in the computation of the output voltage of the fuel cell.

          Polyamides have been shown to bind double-stranded DNA by complementing the curvature of the minor groove and forming various hydrogen bonds with DNA. Several polyamide molecules have been found to have potent antiviral activities against papillomavirus, a double-stranded DNA virus. By analogy, we reason that polyamides may also interact with the structured RNA bound in the nucleocapsid of a negative-strand RNA virus. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was selected as a prototype virus to test this possibility since its genomic RNA encapsidated in the nucleocapsid forms a structure resembling one strand of an A-form RNA duplex. One polyamide molecule, UMSL1011, was found to inhibit infection of VSV. To confirm that the polyamide targeted the nucleocapsid, a nucleocapsid-like particle (NLP) was incubated with UMSL1011. The encapsidated RNA in the polyamide-treated NLP was protected from thermo-release and digestion by RNase A. UMSL1011 also inhibits viral RNA synthesis in the intracellular activity assay for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The crystal structure revealed that UMSL1011 binds the structured RNA in the nucleocapsid. The conclusion of our studies is that the RNA in the nucleocapsid is a viable antiviral target of polyamides. Since the RNA structure in the nucleocapsid is similar in all negative-strand RNA viruses, polyamides may be optimized to target the specific RNA genome of a negative-strand RNA virus, such as respiratory syncytial virus and Ebola virus.
          
            IMPORTANCE
            Negative-strand RNA viruses (NSVs) include several life-threatening pathogens, such as rabies virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Ebola virus. There are no effective antiviral drugs against these viruses. Polyamides offer an exceptional opportunity because they may be optimized to target each NSV. Our studies on vesicular stomatitis virus, an NSV, demonstrated that a polyamide molecule could specifically target the viral RNA in the nucleocapsid and inhibit viral growth. The target specificity of the polyamide molecule was proved by its inhibition of thermo-release and RNA nuclease digestion of the RNA bound in a model nucleocapsid, and a crystal structure of the polyamide inside the nucleocapsid. This encouraging observation provided the proof-of-concept rationale for designing polyamides as antiviral drugs against NSVs.

Synthetic modifications can improve PA-DNA binding affinity and include flexible modules, such as β-alanine (β) motifs to replace pyrroles (Py), and increasing compound charge using N-terminal cationic substituents. To better understand the variations in kinetics and affinities caused by these modifications on PA-DNA interactions, a comprehensive set of PAs with different numbers and positions of β and different types of N-cationic groups was systematically designed and synthesized to bind their cognate sequence, the λB motif. The λB motif is also a strong binding promoter site of the major groove targeting transcription factor PU.1. The PA binding affinities and kinetics were evaluated using a spectrum of powerful biophysical methods: thermal melting, biosensor surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism. The results show that β inserts affect PA-DNA interactions in a number and position dependent manner. Specifically, a β replacement between two imidazole heterocycles (ImβIm) generally strengthens binding. In addition, N-terminal cationic groups can accelerate the association between PA and DNA, but the bulky size of TMG can cause steric hindrance and unfavourable repulsive electrostatic interactions in some PAs. The future design of stronger binding PA requires careful combination of βs and cationic substituents.",,29143012.0,"['Cations', 'Nylons', 'beta-Alanine', 'DNA', 'Binding Sites']",PMC5763910

Using the above method for industrial production of 4-ADPA will help eliminateprincipal shortcomings inherent in the existing industrial methods: reduce unit operations of the process, use more accessible, inexpensive raw materials, increase product yield, eliminate formation of carcinogenic substances, significantly decrease the formation of waste products and, most importantly, decrease the volume of waste water. The most promising methods for industrial production are recent discoveries that use heterogeneous catalysts during condensation of aniline with nitrobenzene, e.g., zeolite ZSM-5 treated with tetramethylammonium hydroxide or highly basic anions which considerably simplify production technology and process control, lower costs and comply with strict environmental requirements.",cc-by-nc,,,

Such compounds are of interest as probes for bioimaging and as biosensors to monitor cellular dynamics and molecular interactions. Desirable biological probes absorb in the visible region, have high extinction coefficients, high quantum yield and excellent photostability. Fluorophores with scaffolding that can be used to tune and optimize solvatochromic behavior are of particular interest. Here, we investigate the environmental sensitivity of a small library of highly fluorescent 2,7-disubstituted sila- and germafluorenes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that charge transfer occurs from the alkyne core out to the 2,7-substitutents and 3,6-methoxy substituents, the hallmark of push–pull behavior. They exhibit HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of about 3 eV with desirable dipole moments ranging from 2 to 9 D. These compounds exhibit desirable Stokes shifts in various solvents (25 to 102 nm). Interestingly, silafluorene with a benzaldehyde substituent exhibits competitive solvatochromic behavior. With the ability to tune push–pull properties via the 2,7-substituent, these disubstituted sila- and germafluorenes have excellent potential as biological probes.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Second, an immigrant threat narrative in political discourse linking immigration to crime and political dysfunction has been extended to the voting domain.

Students found their experiences to be valuable and reported learning generally and specifically related to course material.

Students reported interest in participating in similar research in the future, would recommend other students to do so, and expressed interest in more learning and research about the topics central to their experience.

Research teams, recruited from local colleges and universities and located in twenty-eight election jurisdictions across the United States, observed and timed voters as they entered the queue at their respective polling places and then voted. We report results about four specific polling place operations and practices: the length of the check-in line, the number of voters leaving the check-in line once they have joined it, the time for a voter to check in to vote (i.e., verify voter’s identification and obtain a ballot), and the time to complete a ballot. Long lines, waiting times, and times to vote are closely related to time of day (mornings are busiest for polling places). We found the recent adoption of photographic voter identification (ID) requirements to have a disparate effect on the time to check in among white and nonwhite polling places. In majority-white polling places, scanning a voter’s driver’s license speeds up the check-in process. In majority nonwhite polling locations, the effect of strict voter ID requirements increases time to check in, albeit modestly. ",,,,

However, some sources of public beliefs about voter fraud have received little attention. We identify two conditions that combine to make anti-immigrant attitudes a strong predictor of voter fraud beliefs. First, the recent growth and dispersion of the immigrant population makes immigration a salient consideration for many Americans. Second, an immigrant threat narrative in political discourse linking immigration to crime and political dysfunction has been extended to the voting domain. Using new data from a survey module in the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study and the 2012 American National Election Study, we show that immigrant resentment is strongly associated with voter fraud beliefs. Widespread hostility toward immigrants helps nourish public beliefs about voter fraud and support for voting restrictions in the United States. The conditions generating this relationship in public opinion likely exist in other nations roiled by immigration politics. The topic of fraudulent electoral practices will likely continue to provoke voters to call to mind groups that are politically constructed as “un-American.” ",,,,

The presentation of glycan structures on surfaces for screening of their interaction with protein binding partners, interactions with individual cells, and development of bioassays is an actively developing field. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of glycan terminated alkanethiols on gold have found application in many of these areas. Additionally, more complex structures such as glycan modified polymers on gold surfaces have provided new routes for multivalent glycan presentation. Glycans have also been conjugated to monolayers formed on other useful substrates such as glass or silicon wafers. SAMs have been formed both by direct immobilization of glycan terminated alkanethiols and by conjugation of glycans to pre-formed SAMs with reactive terminal groups. The structure of the SAMs has been characterized using a range of methods including surface spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electrochemical methods. The binding of proteins to these SAMs has been followed using methods including surface plasmon resonance and electrochemical techniques such as impedance spectroscopy. In this chapter, we will seek to review the recent literature concerning SAMs containing terminal glycans, with a focus on their biomolecular interactions. The applications of these glycan-modified SAMs to the screening and study of protein and cellular binding and to biosensor and assay development will be reviewed.",,33224429.0,"['Glycan', 'Biosensing', 'Biomolecular Interactions', 'Self-assembled Monolayers (Sams)']",PMC7673301

However, their efficiency is marred by a necessity to chemically modify DOX, NPs, or both and low deposition of the administered NPs on tumors. Therefore, alternative strategies should be developed to improve therapeutic efficacy and decrease toxicity. Here we report the possibility of employing a monolithic nanoporous gold (np-Au) rod as an implant for delivering DOX. The np-Au has very high DOX encapsulation efficiency (&gt;98%) with maximum loading of 93.4 mg cm−3 without any chemical modification required of DOX or np-Au. We provide a plausible mechanism for the high loading of DOX in np-Au. The DOX sustained release for 26 days from np-Au in different pH conditions at 37 °C, which was monitored using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Additionally, we encased the DOX-loaded np-Au with rapamycin (RAPA)-trapped poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) to fabricate an np-Au@PLGA/RAPA implant and optimized the combinatorial release of DOX and RAPA. Further exploiting the effect of the protein corona around np-Au and np-Au@PLGA/RAPA showed zero-order release kinetics of DOX. This work proves that the np-Au-based implant has the potential to be used as a DOX carrier of potential use in cancer treatment.",cc-by-4.0,,,

In this context, glycosyl thioimidates have previously been used as efficient donors, in the case of hydrolysis or thioglycoligation. In both cases, the release of the thioimidoyl aglycone was remotely activated through a protonation driven by a carboxylic residue in the active site of the corresponding enzymes. A recombinant glucosidase (DtGly) from Dictyoglomus themophilum, previously used in biocatalysis, was also able to use such glycosyl thioimidates as substrates. Yet, enzymatic kinetic values analysis, coupled to mutagenesis and in silico modelling of DtGly/substrate complexes demonstrated that the release of the thioimidoyl moiety during catalysis is only driven by its leaving group ability, without the activation of a remote protonation. In the search of efficient glycosyl donors, glycosyl thioimidates are attractive and efficient. Their utility, however, is limited to enzymes able to promote leaving group release by remote activation.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Deterrence theorists argue that general and specific deterrence can be achieved through such policing strategies. Labeling proponents, however, maintain that juveniles stopped and/or arrested by the police, rather than be deterred, will actually engage in more delinquency as a result of this contact. Research to date has provided mixed evidence. The current study seeks to inform this debate by examining the effect of being stopped or arrested on subsequent delinquent behavior and attitudes. Relying on three waves of data from a multisite sample of youth, we use propensity score matching to control for preexisting differences among youth who have and have not experienced police contact. Our findings reveal that being stopped or arrested not only increases future delinquency but also amplifies deviant attitudes. ",,,,

Method: Data come from a longitudinal sample of middle school students ( N = 3,271) as part of the evaluation of the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) program. A hybrid random effects model is used to estimate the between- and within-individual effects of traditional, cyber-, and dual-bullying victimization while controlling for other predictors of delinquency. Outcomes include general delinquency, violent and nonviolent delinquency, and substance use. Results: The findings demonstrate that those who are cyberbullied exhibit a higher propensity for substance use and nonviolent delinquency compared to those who are traditionally bullied. Changes in dual victimization within respondents over time are most strongly related to general delinquency. With one exception, the effect of traditional bullying victimization remained weakest in all of the models. Conclusions: This study finds evidence that victims of cyberbullying may be more likely to engage in delinquent and deviant behavior compared to victims of traditional bullying. Criminologists and antibullying prevention efforts should consider the broader role of cyberbullying victimization in the developmental processes of adolescents. ",,,,

We examine the influence of gangs in schools through qualitative analysis of 180 in-depth semistructured interviews. The sample includes youth with varying levels of gang involvement who attended schools across the United States. Youth relied on personal knowledge and visual cues to identify gangs in their school. Despite the occurrence of vicarious victimizations and incivilities at the hands of gang youth, respondents indicated that gangs did not impact their school life. These youth frequently used normalization and delimitation processes to deal with gangs in their school.",,,,

However, discriminant validity was not found with this measure. Four of the six revised factors of the BC correlated as expected with life satisfaction, indicating acceptable convergent validity. In addition, discriminant validity was found with this measure. A few differences in coping were found on the basis of age, SES, and gender.Conclusion: The results suggest that the BC, with the revised factors, is a solid measure of coping in individuals with late-deafness.",,,,

Participants consisted of 278 African American female college students enrolled in a large Midwestern university who completed a racial identity measure, an African American enculturation measure, and body dissatisfaction measures. Simultaneous regression results suggested that preencounter self-hatred attitudes were the only racial identity dimension to significantly predict body dissatisfaction. In addition, the level of enculturation significantly predicted body dissatisfaction, suggesting that African American women who were highly enculturated experienced greater body dissatisfaction. Subsequent mediational analyses found that body mass index fully mediated the relationship between enculturation and body dissatisfaction for African American women. Greater enculturation was associated with a higher body mass index, which in turn predicted greater overweight preoccupation. Study implications are discussed. ",,,,

            Method:
            
              The convenience sample consisted of 26 senior-level Master of Science in Nursing students in the Pediatric Nurse Practitioner and Adult-Gerontology Nurse Practitioner programs. A Likert survey was used for evaluation that measured items from 1 (

We introduced equity-oriented mathematics education content and tools based on what emerged from the PLC, then utilized an interpretive approach to analyzing data through a multistage process. Results indicate identity and power tensions that worked against equitable practices.

Typically, they are only offered access to low-rigor school mathematics emphasizing rote procedures and narrow skills, often segregated physically and socially from their nondisabled peers. Educators are crucial to the humanization of disabled students via anti-ableist and antiracist work toward systemic transformation. The purpose of this review is to take stock of the current knowledge base of educator and disability research concerning school mathematics, recommending directions for humanizing future research and practice. Through a humanizing mathematics education lens, we analyze 61 articles involving educators, disabilities, and school mathematics published during the decade between 2007 and 2016. Results of our analysis point to not only the continued perpetuation of dehumanizing approaches and positioning but also substantial shifts toward humanization in mathematics education for disabled students. Over half of the studies reflected humanizing shifts. Yet, overwhelmingly, studies continue to avoid meaningful intersectional considerations of race and disability. ",,,,

However, concerns that people who use drugs will engage in riskier drug behaviors if they have access to naloxone remain prevalent, and the measurement scales to assess these risk compensation concerns remain under researched. This study aims to examine the validity of the Naloxone-Related Risk Compensation Beliefs (NaRRC-B) scale and to understand the effect of overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) training on risk compensation beliefs across demographic and professional populations. <i>Methods:</i> A total of 1424 participants, 803 police officers, 137 emergency medical services (EMS)/fire personnel, and 484 clinical treatment and social service providers were administered surveys before and after attending an OEND training. Survey items measured the endorsement of opioid overdose knowledge and attitudes, as well as risk compensation beliefs. <i>Results:</i> Police and EMS/fire personnel expressed greater endorsement of risk compensation beliefs than clinical treatment and social service providers at both pre- and post-OEND training. Although endorsement of risk compensation beliefs was significantly reduced in each of the 3 groups after the training, reductions were greatest among EMS/fire personnel, followed by providers, then police. Moreover, younger, male, and black participants endorsed greater beliefs in risk compensatory behaviors as compared with their older, female, and white counterparts. <i>Conclusion:</i> This study validated a novel measure of naloxone-related risk compensation beliefs and suggests participating in OEND trainings decreases beliefs in naloxone-related risk compensation behaviors. OEND trainings should consider addressing concerns about naloxone ""enabling"" drug use, particularly in law enforcement settings, to continue to reduce stigma surrounding naloxone availability.",,31170030.0,"['Naloxone', 'Opioid Overdose', 'Harm Reduction', 'Risk Compensation', 'Overdose Education', 'Humans', 'Opioid-Related Disorders', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Risk-Taking', 'Age Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Police', 'Adult', 'Middle Aged', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Female', 'Male', 'Social Stigma', 'Emergency Responders', 'Firefighters', 'Opiate Overdose', 'White People', 'Black or African American']",

The sample was comprised of 13,291 young adults (ages 18-26; Meanage = 22.8) self-identifying as European American (n=9,939) or African American (n=3,335) who participated in Wave III (n = 15,170) of the restricted-use National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We used separate logistic regressions to study participation in specific gam bling categories (lottery games, casino-type games, other games). Childhood neglect, physical discipline, and current alcohol use was associated across each of the three gam bling categories. Our results also revealed differences between European American and African American subjects. Current cannabis use was associated with all three categories among African Americans, while current cigarette use was associated among European Americans for lottery games, and depression (female) was associated with other games. We also applied multinomial logistic regression to study gambling involvement based on the number of gam bling categories that the participant engaged in 2 or more (referent), only 1, or none at all. Our results revealed that delinquency/conduct symptoms (AOR=0.83) along with cannabis use (African American; AOR =0.66), cigarette use (European American; AOR =0.83), current alcohol use (AOR=0.66) were associated with gambling in two categories vs. gambling in one category. Childhood physical discipline (AOR=0.75) and childhood neglect (AOR=0.75) were associated with gam bling in two categories vs. no gambling. Further are needed to investigate the developmental pathways leading to increased gam bling involvement among African American and European American adolescents and young adults.",,30443591.0,,PMC6233904

A wide variety of psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been studied in nurses globally, but many are not studied or understudied in US nurses. Theoretical underpinnings of the current study are based on the disaster component of the Middle-Range Theory of Nurses' Psychological Trauma. Objective To explore the associations of psychological responses (life satisfaction, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptomatology, attitude toward life, and compassion satisfaction), years of experience, and general health in US nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic using network analysis. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from October to November 2020 in US nurses. Network analysis was used to model the data and analyze the centrality indices of betweenness, closeness, and strength. Data were reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Results In 128 nurses, 19.35% of nurses had probable PTSD. Network analysis showed strong significant correlations between life satisfaction and perceived stress (negative), between perceived stress and PTSD symptomatology (positive), and between attitude toward life and compassion satisfaction (positive). Conclusion Low life satisfaction, high perceived stress, and low attitude toward life are key inflection points that signal the need for psychological intervention in the US nursing workforce during the continued pandemic. Based on 2021 Tri-Council of Nursing COVID-19 Report and the 2022 International Council of Nurses guideline, healthcare should implement scalable, system-level interventions to reduce psychological burden during the pandemic. The current study suggests targets for such intervention, which may promote a healthier, more effective US nursing workforce. ",cc-by-nc-4.0,,,

However, this has not been systematically examined among race/ethnic groups, for whom rates of exposure to assaultive violence and SUD differ. This study examined variation by race/ethnicity and gender in associations of alcohol (AUD), cannabis (CUD), and tobacco (TUD) use disorders with three types of childhood interpersonal violence (cIPV): physical abuse, sexual abuse, and witnessing parental violence.MethodData from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol-Related Conditions-III (N: 36 309), a US nationally representative sample, was utilized to examine associations of DSM-5 AUD, CUD and TUD with cIPV among men and women of five racial/ethnic groups. Models were adjusted for additional risk factors (e.g. parental substance use problems, participant's co-occurring SUD).ResultsIndependent contributions of childhood physical and sexual abuse to AUD, CUD, and TUD, and of witnessing parental violence to AUD and TUD were observed. Associations of cIPV and SUD were relatively similar across race/ethnicity and gender [Odds Ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.1 to 1.9], although associations of physical abuse with AUD and TUD were greater among males, associations of parental violence and AUD were greater among females, and associations of parental violence with AUD were greater among Hispanic women and American Indian men.ConclusionsGiven the paucity of research in this area, and the potential identification of modifiable risk factors to reduce the impact of childhood interpersonal violence on SUDs, further research and consideration of tailoring prevention and intervention efforts to different populations are warranted.",,,,

The demand for naloxone, the opioid overdose antidote, is outpacing the supply. With increasing naloxone requests, tools to prioritize distribution are critical to ensure available supplies will reach those at highest risk of overdose. Methods We developed a standardized “Naloxone Request Form” (NRF) and corresponding weighted prioritization algorithm to serve as decisional aid to better enable grant staff to prioritize naloxone distribution in a data-driven manner. The algorithm computed raw priority scores for each agency, which were then separated into the predetermined quintiles. Historical naloxone distribution decisions were compared with agencies’ prioritization quintile. Results Results demonstrated that the NRF and corresponding algorithm was successful at prioritizing agencies based on potential impact. Although, overall, naloxone was distributed more heavily to the agencies deemed highest priority, our algorithm identified significant shortcomings of the “first come, first served” method of distribution we had initially deployed. Conclusions This work has laid the foundation to use this tool prospectively to allow for data-driven decision-making for naloxone distribution. Our tool is flexible and can be customized to best fit the needs of a variety of programs and locations to ensure the distribution of limited supplies of naloxone have the greatest impact.

The number of head blows that result in a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is virtually unknown, but estimates far exceed numbers of TBI in parallel populations (e.g., blast exposure, accidents, sports) combined. Research on the impact of TBI on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) is sparse. This methodology paper describes the comprehensive, multi-method approach used by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from several different fields of expertise to assess the interaction of psychiatric, cognitive, psychological, and physical conditions that result from IPV. Using state-of-the-art instruments, a comprehensive assessment of lifetime trauma exposure, lifetime history of TBI, psychiatric history, and a full assessment of current cognitive, neuropsychological and biomedical function was conducted with 51 female survivors of IPV who screened positive for PTSD. This multi-method assessment included clinician-administered diagnostic interviews modified to specifically assess the sequelae of IPV, standardized self-report surveys, neuropsychological tests, structural, diffusion, and functional neuroimaging and blood-based biomarkers. The specific details and full report of the results of the full study are beyond the scope of this methodology paper. Descriptive characteristics of the complex clinical presentation observed in this unique sample are described. The sample reported high rates of trauma exposure across the lifespan and 80% met full criteria for current PTSD. Women also reported high rates of lifetime subconcussive head injury (88.2%) and TBI (52.9%) from various etiologies (35.3% secondary to IPV). Descriptive findings from the methodological protocol described here have begun to reveal information that will advance our understanding of the impact of subconcussive head injury and TBI on recovery from mental injury among IPV survivors.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Adult sexual victimization itself has been linked with psychopathology but has predominately been studied in women. The current investigation examines the impact of CM and co-occurring psychopathology on adult sexual victimization in men and women, replicating findings in three distinct samples.MethodWe investigated the association between continuous CM factor scores and adult sexual victimization in the Childhood Trauma Study (CTS) sample (N = 2564). We also examined the unique relationship between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and adult sexual victimization while adjusting for co-occurring substance dependence and psychopathology. We replicated these analyses in two additional samples: the Comorbidity and Trauma Study (CATS; N = 1981) and the Australian Twin-Family Study of Alcohol Use Disorders (OZ-ALC; N = 1537).ResultsAnalyses revealed a significant association with CM factor scores and adult sexual victimization for both men and women across all three samples. The CSA factor score was strongly associated with adult sexual victimization after adjusting for substance dependence and psychopathology; higher odds ratios were observed in men (than women) consistently across the three samples.ConclusionsA continuous measure of CSA is independently associated with adult sexual trauma risk across samples in models that included commonly associated substance dependence and psychopathology as covariates. The strength of the association between this CSA measure and adult sexual victimization is higher in magnitude for men than women, pointing to the need for further investigation of sexual victimization in male community samples.",,,,

            Objective
            Nurses' voluntary reporting of adverse events and errors is critical for improving patient safety. The operationalization and application of the concept, patient safety culture, warrant further study. The objectives are to explore the underlying factor structure, the correlational relationship, between items of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture and examine its construct validity.
          
          
            Methods
            Exploratory factor analysis was conducted using secondary data from the instrument’s database. Using pattern matching, factors obtained through exploratory factor analysis were compared with the 6-component Patient Safety Culture Theoretical Framework: degree of psychological safety, degree of organizational culture, quality of culture of safety, degree of high reliability organization, degree of deference to expertise, and extent of resilience.
          
          
            Results
            6 exploratory factors, explaining 51% of the total variance, were communication lead/speak out/resilience, organizational culture and culture of safety–environment, psychological safety–security/protection, psychological safety-support/trust, patient safety, communication, and reporting for patient safety. All factors had moderate to very strong associations (range, 0.354–0.924). Overall, construct validity was good, but few exploratory factors matched the theoretical components of degree of deference to expertise and extent of resilience.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Factors essential to creating an environment of transparent, voluntary error reporting are proposed. Items are needed, specifically focusing on deference to expertise, the ability of the person with the most experience to speak up and lead, despite hierarchy or traditional roles, and resilience, which is coping and moving forward after adversity or mistakes. With future studies, a supplemental survey with these items may be proposed.

Trauma exposures (e.g., sexual abuse [SA], physical abuse [PA], witnessing another person being killed or injured, experiencing an accident, and experiencing a disaster) were modeled as time-varying predictors of alcohol initiation, transition to first alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptom, and transition to AUD diagnosis using Cox proportional hazards regression while taking into account other substance involvement, parental characteristics, and commonly co-occurring psychiatric disorders.<h4>Results</h4>In EA women only, SA was associated with alcohol initiation prior to the age of 14, PA predicted transition from initiation to first AUD symptom, and PA, witnessing injury or death, and SA predicted transition to AUD diagnosis. No association was discovered between trauma exposures or PTSD for any stage of alcohol involvement in AA women.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Results reveal trauma experiences as important contributors to all stages of alcohol involvement in EA women only, with different trauma types conferring risk for each stage of alcohol involvement.

Consequently, we propose a dynamic perspective for understanding the relationship between voluntary organizations and neighborhood crime that involves longitudinal analyses and the measurement of the age of organizations. By using longitudinal data on a sample of census blocks (N = 87,641) located across 10 cities, we test the relationship between age‐graded measures of different types of voluntary organizations and neighborhood crime rates. We use fixed‐effects negative binomial regression models that focus on change within neighborhoods of the relationship between voluntary organizations and neighborhood crime. Our results show that although each type of voluntary organization is found to exhibit crime‐reducing behavior in neighborhoods, we find that many of them are consistent with what we refer to as the “delayed impact scenario”—there is a pronounced delay between the placement of a voluntary organization and a neighborhood subsequently experiencing a reduction in crime. With protective effects of organizations typically not demonstrated until several years after being in the neighborhood, these patterns suggest a need for long‐term investment strategies when examining organizations.",,,,

This variability may indicate disagreement among residents with implications for the neighborhood collectivity. The authors propose using a general measure of social distance based on several social dimensions (rather than measures based on a single dimension such as racial/ethnic heterogeneity or income inequality) to help understand this variability in assessments. The authors use data from wave I (2001) of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey ( n = 3,570) to aggregate respondents into egohoods of two different sizes: quarter-mile and half-mile radii. Consistent with expectations, neighborhoods with higher levels of general social distance have higher variability in reports of neighboring and the two components of collective efficacy, cohesion and informal social control.

It is well established that childhood maltreatment is a significant risk factor for depression. ELS is positively correlated with depressive symptoms both in major depression disorder patients and healthy individuals, but the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear. In the present study, we calculate the within/between-network connectivity in 528 college students, and Pearson correlation was performed to investigate the relationship between network measures and ELS. Additionally, the same method was applied to verify these results in another sample. Finally, mediation analysis was performed to explore the cognitive and neural mechanisms regarding the association between ELS and depression. Correlation analysis indicated that ELS was positively correlated with the within-network connectivity of the ventral attention network (VAN), the dorsal attention network (DAN), the salience network (SN), the somatosensory network (SMN) and the between-network connectivity of ventral attention network-dorsal attention network (VAN-DAN), ventral attention network- somatosensory network (VAN-SMN), and ventral attention network-visual network (VAN-VN). Validation results indicated that ELS is associated with the within-network connectivity of VAN and DAN. Mediation analysis revealed that attention bias and the within-network connectivity of VAN could mediated the relationship between ELS and depression. Both behavioral and neural evidence emphasize ELS’s influence on individual’s emotion attention. Furthermore, the present study also provides two possible mediation models to explain the potential mechanisms behind the relationship between ELS and depression.",cc-by-4.0,,,

The concept of school relationship is important to student outcomes, including academic performance, risk behaviors, and mental health. Typically, measures of school life have tended to be multidimensional, covering various areas of student life on campus. In this study, we focus on a relationship component as an essential aspect of school climate concept. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and reliability analysis were conducted based on samples from two countries (United States and China).

Existing research on gender differences in character development has established a certain stereotype of girls outperforming boys in western culture. Methods: Based on a sample of 695 students in elementary, middle, and high school students, we analyzed gender differences in character development in the Chinese cultural context using multidimensional scaling (MDS) profile analysis, providing a cultural account of gender differences via profile patterns. Results: Our study identified specific items where pre-adolescent and adolescent boys outperformed girls (while acknowledging there are also specific items where girls outperformed boys) based on data sourced from a Chinese context. We found gender differences in the same character strengths due to situational factors, such as intensive and sustained educational interventions and established gender traditions/expectations, which can shape the exhibition of particular character strengths differently among girls and boys. Conclusion: Findings can offer an antidote to a Western-dominated research perspective on character or moral education. It enriches the literature on moral education in a different cultural context and provides evidence of gender differences in character strengths.",cc-by-4.0,,,

It has detrimental effects on individuals and society. Rejection sensitivity, a disposition that one tends to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to social rejection, has been associated with reactive aggression. Considering that the mechanism underlying this link remains unclear, this study explores the mediating role of loneliness and maladaptive coping. Participants included 1104 early adults between the ages of 17–23 ( Mage = 20.35, SD = 1.11, 33.6% men) in China who completed the Chinese version of the Tendency to Expect Rejection Scale, Loneliness Scale, Ways of Coping Questionnaire, and Reactive-Active Aggression Questionnaire. The serial mediation model revealed that loneliness and maladaptive coping independently mediated the association of rejection sensitivity with reactive aggression. More importantly, the chain mediating effect of “loneliness-maladaptive coping” also accounted for this link. The above findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationships among these factors and suggested that rejection sensitivity could positively be related to reactive aggression through loneliness and maladaptive coping.

          Background and aims
          Internet pornography consumption is prevalent among college students and problematic for some, yet little is known regarding the psychological constructs underlying problematic Internet pornography use (PIPU). Drawing on the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model, this study tested a model that sexual sensation seeking (SSS) would impact PIPU through online sexual activities (OSAs) and that this relationship would be influenced by the third-person effect (TPE; a social cognitive bias relating to perceived impacts on others as compared to oneself) in a gender-sensitive manner.
        
        
          Methods
          A total of 808 Chinese college students (age range: 17–22 years, 57.7% male) were recruited and surveyed.
        
        
          Results
          Men scored higher than women on OSAs and PIPU and on each scale’s component factors. The relationship between SSS and PIPU was mediated by OSAs, and the TPE moderated this relationship: the predictive path (SSS to PIPU) was significant only in participants with high TPE. The moderated mediation model was not invariant across gender groups, with data suggesting that it accounted for a greater proportion of the variance in men as compared with women.
        
        
          Discussion and conclusions
          The findings suggest that SSS may operate through participation in OSAs to lead to PIPU, and this relationship is particularly relevant for college-aged males scoring high on the TPE. These findings have implications for individuals who might be particularly vulnerable to developing PIPU and for guiding educational efforts and targeting interventions in college-aged students. The extent to which these findings extend to other age groups and cultures warrants further examination.

Anxious individuals tend to experience more worry under uncertainty and processing uncertain information is an important, but often overlooked factor in anxiety. So, we decided to explore the brain correlates of processing uncertain information in individuals with high trait anxiety using the learn-test paradigm. Behaviorally, the percentages on memory test and the likelihood ratios of identifying novel stimuli under uncertainty were similar to the certain fear condition, but different from the certain neutral condition. The brain results showed that the visual cortex, bilateral fusiform gyrus and right parahippocampal gyrus were active during the processing of uncertain cues. Moreover, we found that trait anxiety was positively correlated with the BOLD signal of the right parahippocampal gyrus during the processing of uncertain cues. No significant results were found in the amygdala during uncertain cue processing. These results suggest that memory retrieval is associated with uncertain cue processing, which is underpinned by over-activation of the right parahippocampal gyrus, in individuals with high trait anxiety.",cc-by-4.0,,,

There were two research questions: 1) What interactions occurred among online TESOL practicum course participants? and 2) What was the impact of the online TESOL practicum course on participants' EL teaching? The results showed that students interacted more among themselves than with the instructor. Three themes emerged from qualitative data analysis; acknowledgment, impact of cyclic coaching, and linguistically responsive EL-teaching. The results ensured students' active interaction at the virtual communal spaces with some challenges and enhancement of their EL-teaching due to cyclic online coaching.",,,,

The qualitative data source was from three in-service teachers’ observations and interviews. The interview and observation data were analyzed using open and axial coding and activity systems. Three themes emerged: 1) mathematics-related content teaching practices, 2) tools to support mathematics learning, and 3) teachers’ mindsets and attitudes towards English Learner (EL) teaching. The researchers then compared verbatim examples using activity systems to examine the following research question: How did participating urban in-service teachers apply linguistically and culturally responsive mathematics teaching competences for ELs learned at a university EL teacher training program to their actual mathematics teaching in the classroom? The results, in general, indicated that the urban in-service teachers demonstrated improvement of LCRMT strategies that they used in their actual mathematics teaching after they completed the university training. However, challenges in the areas of mathematical discourse competences and teachers’ sociocultural beliefs toward ELs revealed the need for ongoing professional support.",,,,

First, the authors expand the emerging framework of translanguaging beyond the individual competency toward a collaborative practice across family/community members and diverse sign systems. Then, the authors describe how a multilingual family literacy project created a community translanguaging space that maximized leveraging of family funds of knowledge: collective community semiotic repertoires. Participating families (parents, children, and extended family/community members) collectively built larger communicative repertoires by connecting across individual linguistic, multimodal, and cultural capacities and experiences to create each unique family storybook. Finally, the authors provide suggestions on designing and implementing community‐based family literacy projects.",,,,

However, the performance of these centres varies significantly between hospitals. The aim of this study is to address two research questions: (i) what are the critical factors for implementing high-performance HSCs and (ii) how are these critical factors used in the development of implementation strategies to achieve satisfactory performance?<h4>Methods</h4>Following a literature review on information technology (IT) implementation, we identified a framework comprising four key dimensions for HSCs implementation: technology, organisation, environment and individuals. This TOEI (technology-organisation-environment-individual) framework was then used as a basis for a multicentre case study through which data collection and analysis proceeded. We collected 12 one-to-one in-depth interviews alongside secondary data from six high-performance HSCs in mainland China.<h4>Results</h4>Our study identifies critical TOEI factors that collectively influence HSC implementation performance and major activities at the six high-performance HSCs. Three strategies for implementing high-performance HSCs are also identified: facility management platform, education and training centre and innovation centre.<h4>Conclusions</h4>HSC implementation is an holistic approach. The critical TOEI factors collectively build a foundation for centre activities. An HSC's implementation strategy highly relies on organisational strategic goals. Additionally, HSCs in mainland China face some common challenges such as faculty retention and future opportunities such as expanding the research scope. Our study also provides insights for hospital leadership, medical associations and policymakers.",,35128724.0,"['Humans', 'Leadership', 'Faculty', 'Hospitals', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Delivery of Health Care']",

Understanding how hospitals can continue providing services in an effective manner under these circumstances is thus important. In this study, we investigate how information technology (IT) helped hospitals in mainland China better respond to the outbreak of the pandemic.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We conducted a content analysis of pages published on the websites of the top 50 hospitals in mainland China between January 22 and February 21, 2020. In total, we analyzed 368 pages that the hospitals published during the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose was to identify common themes related to the utilization of IT by these hospitals in response to the pandemic's outbreak.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 5 focal themes across the webpages published by the hospitals during our study period, including (1) popular medical science education, (2) digitalized hospital processes, (3) knowledge management for medical professionals, (4) telemedicine, and (5) new IT initiatives for healthcare services. Our analysis revealed that Chinese hospitals spent greater effort in promoting popular medical science education in the initial stages of our study period and more on telemedicine in the latter stages.<h4>Discussion</h4>We propose a configurational approach for hospitals to design response strategies to pandemic outbreaks based on their available resources.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study provides rich insights for hospitals to better utilize their IT resources and some recommendations for policymaker to better support hospitals in the future.",,32311036.0,"['Mainland China', 'Covid-19 Pandemic', 'Hospital Responding Strategy', 'It-enabled Services', 'Humans', 'Pneumonia, Viral', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Hospital Administration', 'Telemedicine', 'Education, Medical', 'Internet', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Informatics Applications', 'Hospitals', 'China', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Consumer Health Information', 'Pandemics', 'Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2']",PMC7188168

The synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is a powerful method for instantaneous frequency estimation and component separation of non-stationary multicomponent signals. The short-time Fourier transform-based SST (FSST) reassigns the frequency variable to sharpen the time-frequency representation and to separate the components of a multicomponent non-stationary signal. Very recently the FSST with a time-varying parameter, called the adaptive FSST, was introduced. The simulation experiments show that the adaptive FSST is very promising in instantaneous frequency estimation of the component of a multicomponent signal, and in accurate component recovery. However, the theoretical analysis of the adaptive FSST has not been carried out. In this paper, we study the theoretical analysis of the adaptive FSST and obtain the error bounds for the instantaneous frequency estimation and component recovery with the adaptive FSST and the second-order adaptive FSST.

Stat.,Frontiers Media SA,,8,,2022-03-17,"['Applied Mathematics', 'Statistics and Probability']","The synchrosqueezing transform (SST) and its variants have been developed recently as an alternative to the empirical mode decomposition scheme to model a non-stationary signal as a superposition of amplitude- and frequency-modulated Fourier-like oscillatory modes. In particular, SST performs very well in estimating instantaneous frequencies (IFs) and separating the components of non-stationary multicomponent signals with slowly changing frequencies. However its performance is not desirable for signals having fast-changing frequencies. Two approaches have been proposed for this issue. One is to use the 2nd-order or high-order SST, and the other is to apply the instantaneous frequency-embedded SST (IFE-SST). For the SST or high order SST approach, one single phase transformation is applied to estimate the IFs of all components of a signal, which may yield not very accurate results in IF estimation and component recovery. IFE-SST uses an estimation of the IF of a targeted component to produce accurate IF estimation. The phase transformation of IFE-SST is associated with the targeted component. Hence the IFE-SST has certain advantages over SST in IF estimation and signal separation. In this article, we provide theoretical study on the instantaneous frequency-embedded short-time Fourier transform (IFE-STFT) and the associated SST, called IFE-FSST. We establish reconstructing properties of IFE-STFT with integrals involving the frequency variable only and provide reconstruction formula for individual components. We also consider the 2nd-order IFE-FSST.",cc-by-4.0,,,

On the other hand side, most of the natural images have the characteristic of nonlocal self-similarity that motivates low-rank representations of them. We would employ both the fractal image coding and the nonlocal self-similarity priors to achieve image compression in image denoising problems. Specifically, we propose a new image denoising model consisting of three terms: a patch-based nonlocal low-rank prior, a data-fidelity term describing the closeness of the underlying image to the given noisy image, and a quadratic term measuring the closeness of the underlying image to a fractal image. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in terms of peak-signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index and mean absolute error. ",,,,

This article is a short intellectual history of the idea of cultural evolution and its critics, the cultural relativists, from the Age of the Enlightenment, what David Deutsch called the “beginning of infinity,” to the neo-Hegelianism of Francis Fukuyama. The emphasis here is on Europe and the Americas and the argument is that the universal evolutionism of the Enlightenment ultimately prevailed over historical partic-ularism, as global disparities in social development, which were once profound, narrowed or even disappeared altogether.",cc-by,,,

Inflammation has been recognized as a primary contributor to the disease and was a tremendous step forward in the description and treatment of DES. Although most treatments of DES treat inflammation, the signs and symptoms of DES usually return shortly after discontinuing the use of the anti-inflammatory agent;<h4>Case</h4>We present a case of a 70-year-old patient who presents with significant dry eye symptoms for 2 years. She reports the need to wear sunglasses during all waking hours, both indoors and out, and had discontinued her hobby of gardening. She had ocular rosacea diagnosed at a previous ophthalmology practice and did not respond to any past treatments. The patient was treated with 25% platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and experienced significant improvement and a return to a normal quality of life that has continued for more than a year after discontinuing treatment;<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our group is investigating the use of biologic therapeutics in the treatment of various forms of DES. We suggest that a clinically acceptable dosage of PRP provides the ocular surface with the components necessary to restore normal cellular tensegrity and provides a foundation to eliminate the recurrence of the inflammation associated with DES.",,23231408.0,"['Lacrimal Apparatus', 'Tears', 'Humans', 'Dry Eye Syndromes', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Platelet-Rich Plasma']",

As these two problems are concerned with different yet equally important features, either method seldom delivers a complete description of the scene when used alone. Yet, research community has largely treated them as separate problems and thus resulted in two entirely different sets of solutions, complicating both implementation and usage. In this paper, we present a stylistic image binarization method called hybrid difference of Gaussians (HDoG) that performs both line drawing and screentoning in a unified framework. Our method is based upon two different extensions of DoG operator: one for line extraction, and the other for tone description. In particular, we propose an extension called adaptive DoG, that uses luminance as weight to automatically generate screentone that adapts to the local tone. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid method effectively generates aesthetically pleasing image binarizations that encompass both line drawing and screentoning, closely resembling professional pen-and-ink illustrations. Also, being based on Gaussian filtering, our method is very fast and also easy to implement. ",,,,

               Warrants are commonplace in the USA, especially bench warrants issued for non-compliance with court orders. Although warrants compel arrest, in practice, officers exercise discretion when enforcing low-level warrants; yet, this discretion goes undocumented and data on warrant enforcement are limited. This collaboration between St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department and the University of Missouri—St. Louis addresses these gaps. Using arrest data, we find that warrant arrests in St. Louis declined from 2002 to 2019. One-third of arrests involve a bench warrant, primarily stemming from traffic violations, and many involve no new charges. Racial disparities in warrant enforcement exist, but data are needed to uncover why. Informal focus groups and meetings with St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department personnel held from 2018 to 2021 provide insight into the role of warrants in officer decision making. We argue that reducing resources devoted to warrant enforcement and racial disparities requires collaboration between police and other stakeholders.",,,,

However, many persons under correctional supervision face substantial barriers in securing and maintaining housing, a fact that is heightened among individuals with a sexual offense conviction. Although frequent movement is commonplace among people on parole, it is unclear how housing changes affect recidivism outcomes and whether such mobility uniquely impacts individuals with a sexual offense conviction. In the present study, we use a quasi-experimental propensity score weighting design to compare a sample of individuals paroled from prison in Michigan for sexual and non-sexual crimes ( N = 3930) to consider the role of housing mobility on the likelihood of rearrests and technical revocation, with attention to disaggregating sexual crimes against adults and children. Results suggest that increased movement was distinctly associated with a higher hazard of rearrest for individuals with a sexual offense conviction, and a strong predictor of technical return hazard for both individuals with sexual and non-sexual convictions.

Yet, little is known about how individuals under correctional supervision experience and perceive legal debt. Understanding perceptions of LFOs is critical as research suggests that individuals who believe that criminal justice sanctions are fair and just are more likely to perceive the system as legitimate and comply. The current study examines in-depth interview data with individuals on probation or parole to understand perspectives of LFOs and what factors may condition these views. The results suggest that participants’ views are quite varied—expressing that they deserve some level of financial punishment, particularly in restitution cases, but they question additional costs that are not directly linked to the circumstances of the case, such as supervision fees, that exacerbate a perceived experience of double jeopardy or contradict the perceived purpose of the monetary assessment. Subgroup analyses suggest that individuals with a conviction for a sexual offense have secondary financial sanctions that deepen perceptions of inequities in the system. ",,,,

               In the US, financial security in retirement depends on having savings and other assets accumulated during the pre-retirement years. Pension savings accrue over the working life, in defined-benefit or defined-contribution retirement plans. Mothers with children with disabilities experience different life-course work trajectories than mothers without children with disabilities, though data used in previous studies primarily examine a single point in time or a short span of years. This paper draws longitudinal data from the nationally-representative 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth for the years 1987 through 2018, using a life-course perspective and sequence analysis to identify long-term work patterns among women with children who do and do not have disabilities with an explicit focus on variations in occupational class and employment status. We found a distinctive pattern of long-term work history with five types: Full-time semi-professional to not working, Constantly not working, Semi-professional full time, Professional full time, and Not working to full time work. Results from regression analyses revealed variation in mothers’ household financial preparation for retirement at late mid-adulthood. Compared with mothers who held professional full-time jobs throughout their adulthood, mothers who started full time jobs in middle age and have children with disabilities were less likely to have pension plans. Mothers of children with disabilities who left the labor force in early middle age tended to have lower retirement savings. Policy interventions to address these mothers’ caregiving ability to stay engaged in the workforce and prepare for their retirement need to be explored.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Children with developmental disabilities are at a high risk for injuries due to a combination of environmental barriers and health conditions. However, little research has assessed the prevalence of injuries among this population in China. Using administrative data from a micro insurance programme for children with developmental disabilities (such as autism, intellectual disability, cerebral palsy and Down syndrome) under the age of 19, we estimated the risk of unintentional injuries reported in insurance claims. Between 2017 and 2020, there were 190 insurance claims (0.53%) reporting nonfatal unintentional injuries and six reporting fatal injuries. The cumulative hazard rate of unintentional injuries by the end of 1 year is 1.21% and is negatively associated with children's age. These findings suggest the need for increased safety support for children with developmental disabilities, particularly in early childhood.",,,,

The CdZnO/MgZnO QW structure with higher Cd composition, which has deeper and stronger confinement, is found to have smaller optical gain because the strain-induced piezoelectric polarization and spontaneous polarization in the well increase with the inclusion of Cd. The internal field and polarization is reduced effectively by using the ferroelectric dipole moment of the Li addition in the well region of the Li-doped CdZnO/ZnMgO QW structure. These results demonstrate that a high-performance optical devices operation can be realized in CdZnO/MgZnO QW structures by eliminating the droop phenomenon.",,,,

Such non-Markovian dynamics take place in a variety of chemical and biological systems. Using the path integral approach, we constructed the conditional probability for passing between two stationary states in configurational space. Our relations can be used for Monte Carlo sampling of evolution trajectories for systems with many degrees of freedom as well as for determining the reaction coordinate used in transition state theory. On the basis of our relation for a conditional probability, we generalize the method of determining the most probable path to the case of colored random force. Using the simple three-hole potential, we examine numerically the effect of nonzero correlation time (memory) on the evolution of the most probable path for a finite temperature.",,18303872.0,,

The structure of the new lead compound was developed based on predictive computational experiments. LPS antagonism by the lead compound was not straightforward, and a biphasic effect was observed suggesting a possibility of more than one binding site. An IC<sub>50</sub> value of 13 nM for the new compound was determined for the possible high affinity site. The combination of computational, synthetic, and biological studies revealed new structural determinants of these simplified analogues.

It is a three-protein complex essential for the production of mature interleukin 1-β. The complex, which is comprised of three proteins, NLRP3, ASC, and pro-caspase-1, has been implicated in the physiological response to pathogenic elements of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. Investigations into the properties of the three proteins can be aided by larger-scale recombinant expression to produce adequate amounts. In the current study, a variety of NLRP3 inflammasome proteins were expressed in the ExpiCHO-S mammalian cell system with a particular focus on ASC. ASC fusion proteins with glutathione-S transferase, maltose-binding protein, and SUMO increased solubility and aided in determining the stability and oligomerization propensity of individual ASC domains and full-length ASC. ASC oligomerization was highly sensitive to protein concentration, ionic strength, and mutation. These observations provided strategic ways to enhance protein purification and characterize ASC oligomerization. The ExpiCHO-S expression system consistently produced high-yield recombinant NLRP3 inflammasome proteins which led to a further understanding of ASC oligomerization.",,33811748.0,"['ASC', 'Inflammasome', 'caspase-1', 'Nlrp3', 'Expicho-s', 'Animals', 'Mammals', 'Interleukin-1beta', 'Inflammasomes', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein']",

Benefit Cost Anal.,Cambridge University Press (CUP),1,11,76-100,2020-01-01,"['Public Administration', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","AbstractIn 1992, Congress passed The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act with the goal of “full restoration of The Elwha River Ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries.” As part of that act, the federal government was required to produce a benefit-cost analysis on dam removal of the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams, which was published in 1994. This article revisits that initial 1994 benefit-cost analysis; background on its methods and assumptions is given, comparisons are made to current state-of-the-art techniques in benefit-cost analysis, and an ex post benefit-cost analysis of the project is conducted for comparison purposes. We find that the cost and scope of the project exceeded original expectations, the cost of the foregone electricity generation was less than expected, and that anticipated recreational and fisheries benefits were both delayed, and lower, than expected. Furthermore, issues such as the value of hatchery-spawned versus wild anadromous fish seem not to have been anticipated in the original analysis, highlighting the fact that in doing an ex ante analysis, researchers must expect that unexpected factors may influence the ex post results of any project.",,,,

And are they used with consistency by academics in the field? Utilizing a data set of articles published in the American Economic Review from 1990 to 2008, we investigate whether there is heterogeneity in JEL codes assignments between authors and editors. We find that there is. A secondary goal of this paper is to survey overall thematic trends in JEL code usage over the past four and a half decades. One result is that JEL category M: Business Economics, in particular, appears to be thematically and spatially distinct from much of the rest of the published literature in the top general interest journals in the field.",,,,

Several studies indicate that the acute phase of COVID-19 may be followed by persistent symptoms including fatigue, dyspnea, headache, musculoskeletal symptoms, and pulmonary functional-and radiological abnormalities. However, the impact of COVID-19 on long-term health outcomes remains to be elucidated. <b>Aims</b>: The Precision Medicine for more Oxygen (P4O2) consortium COVID-19 extension aims to identify long COVID patients that are at risk for developing chronic lung disease and furthermore, to identify treatable traits and innovative personalized therapeutic strategies for prevention and treatment. This study aims to describe the study design and first results of the P4O2 COVID-19 cohort. <b>Methods</b>: The P4O2 COVID-19 study is a prospective multicenter cohort study that includes nested personalized counseling intervention trial. Patients, aged 40-65 years, were recruited from outpatient post-COVID clinics from five hospitals in The Netherlands. During study visits at 3-6 and 12-18 months post-COVID-19, data from medical records, pulmonary function tests, chest computed tomography scans and biological samples were collected and questionnaires were administered. Furthermore, exposome data was collected at the patient's home and state-of-the-art imaging techniques as well as multi-omics analyses will be performed on collected data. <b>Results</b>: 95 long COVID patients were enrolled between May 2021 and September 2022. The current study showed persistence of clinical symptoms and signs of pulmonary function test/radiological abnormalities in post-COVID patients at 3-6 months post-COVID. The most commonly reported symptoms included respiratory symptoms (78.9%), neurological symptoms (68.4%) and fatigue (67.4%). Female sex and infection with the Delta, compared with the Beta, SARS-CoV-2 variant were significantly associated with more persisting symptom categories. <b>Conclusions</b>: The P4O2 COVID-19 study contributes to our understanding of the long-term health impacts of COVID-19. Furthermore, P4O2 COVID-19 can lead to the identification of different phenotypes of long COVID patients, for example those that are at risk for developing chronic lung disease. Understanding the mechanisms behind the different phenotypes and identifying these patients at an early stage can help to develop and optimize prevention and treatment strategies.",cc-by,37511673.0,"['Infectious disease', 'Precision Medicine', 'Prospective Observational Cohort Study', 'Long Covid']",PMC10381397

In this study, a sulfoquinovosyl transferase-like protein, designated as SQD2.2 involved in seed setting and flavonoid accumulation, was identified and characterized in rice. Rice SQD2.2 is localized to the cytoplasm, and the SQD2.2 transcript was highest in leaves. Rice SQD2.2-overexpressing (OE) plants exhibited a decreased seed setting rate and diminished tiller number simultaneously with an increased glycosidic flavonoid level compared with wild-type (WT) plants. SQD2.2 catalyzes the glycosylation of apigenin to produce apigenin 7-O-glucoside using uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDPG) as a sugar donor, but it failed to compensate for sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) synthesis in the Arabidopsis sqd2 mutant. Furthermore, apigenin 7-O-glucoside inhibited starch synthase (SS) activity in a concentration-dependent manner, and SQD2.2-OE plants exhibited reduced SS activity accompanied by a significant reduction in starch levels and an elevation in soluble sugar levels relative to WT plants. Both adenosine diphosphate-glucose (ADPG) and UDPG levels in SQD2.2-OE plants were notably lower than those in WT plants. Taken together, rice SQD2.2 exhibits a novel role in flavonoid synthesis and plays an important role in mediating sugar allocation between primary and secondary metabolism in rice.",cc-by-4.0,,,

The ratio of phospholipids to galactolipids was 1.5 fold higher in root hairs than in stripped roots. Under Pi deficiency, the ratio of phospholipids to galactolipids in stripped roots decreased with the greatest decrease found in the level of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in root hairs and stripped roots, and root hairs had an increased level of phosphatidic acid (PA). When seedlings were not supplied with N, the level of the N-containing lipids PE and phosphatidylserine in root hairs decreased whereas the level of non-N-containing lipids galactolipids and PA increased compared to N-supplied conditions. In stripped roots, the level of major membrane lipids was not different between N-sufficient and -deficient conditions.

Overexpression of GAPC enhances heat tolerance of seedlings and the expression of heat-inducible genes whereas knockout of GAPCs has opposite effects. Screening of Arabidopsis transcription factors identifies nuclear factor Y subunit C10 (NF-YC10) as a GAPC-binding protein. The effects of GAPC overexpression are abolished when NF-YC10 is deficient, the heat-induced nuclear accumulation of GAPC is suppressed, or the GAPC-NF-YC10 interaction is disrupted. GAPC overexpression also enhances the binding ability of NF-YC10 to its target promoter.

Plant oils are valuable commodities for food, feed, renewable industrial feedstocks and biofuels. To increase vegetable oil production, here we show that the nonspecific phospholipase C6 (NPC6) promotes seed oil production in the Brassicaceae seed oil species Arabidopsis, Camelina and oilseed rape.

Overexpression of NPC6 increased seed oil content, seed weight and oil yield both in Arabidopsis and Camelina, whereas knockout of NPC6 decreased seed oil content and seed size. NPC6 is associated with the chloroplasts and microsomal membranes, and hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine and galactolipids to produce diacylglycerol. Knockout and overexpression of NPC6 decreased and increased, respectively, the flux of fatty acids from phospholipids and galactolipids into triacylglycerol production.

Candidate‐gene association study in oilseed rape indicates that only BnNPC6.C01 of the four homeologues NPC6s is associated with seed oil content and yield. Haplotypic analysis indicates that the BnNPC6.C01 favorable haplotype can increase both seed oil content and seed yield.

These results indicate that NPC6 promotes membrane glycerolipid turnover to accumulate TAG production in oil seeds and that NPC6 has a great application potential for oil yield improvement.

               Lipids function not only as the major structural components of cell membranes, but also as molecular messengers that transduce signals to trigger downstream signaling events in the cell. Phosphatidic acid (PA), the simplest and a minor class of glycerophospholipids, is a key intermediate for the synthesis of membrane and storage lipids, and also plays important roles in mediating diverse cellular and physiological processes in eukaryotes ranging from microbes to mammals and higher plants. PA comprises different molecular species that can act differently, and is found in virtually all organisms, tissues, and organellar membranes, with variations in total content and molecular species composition. The cellular levels of PA are highly dynamic in response to stimuli and multiple enzymatic reactions can mediate its production and degradation. Moreover, its unique physicochemical properties compared with other glycerophospholipids allow PA to influence membrane structure and dynamics, and interact with various proteins. PA has emerged as a class of new lipid mediators modulating various signaling and cellular processes via its versatile effects, such as membrane tethering, conformational changes, and enzymatic activities of target proteins, and vesicular trafficking.",,,,

                Background
                Lipid transporters play an essential role in lipid delivery and distribution, but their influence on seed oil production in oilseed crops is not well studied.
              
                Results
                Here, we examined the effect of two lipid transporters, FAX1 (fatty acid export1) and ABCA9 (ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily A9) on oil production and lipid metabolism in the oilseed plant Camelina sativa. Overexpression (OE) of FAX1 and ABCA9 increased seed weight and size, with FAX1-OEs and ABCA9-OEs increasing seed length and width, respectively, whereas FAX1/ABCA9-OEs increasing both. FAX1-OE and ABCA9-OE displayed additive effects on seed oil content and seed yield. Also, OE of FAX1 and ABCA9 affected membrane lipid composition in developing pods, especially on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The expression of some genes involved in seed oil synthesis, such as DGAT2, PDAT1, and LEC1, was increased in developing seeds of FAX1- and/or ABCA9-OEs.
              
                Conclusion
                These results indicate that increased expression of FAX1 and ABCA9 can potentially be applied to improving camelina oil production.

We found previously that increased expression of phospholipase Dε (PLDε), which hydrolyzes phospholipids into phosphatidic acid (PA), enhanced plant growth under nitrogen deficiency in Brassicaceae species Arabidopsis and canola. The present study investigated the effect of AtPLDε-overexpression (OE) on soybean (Glycine max), a species capable of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. AtPLDε-OE soybean plants displayed increased root length and leaf size, and the effect of AtPLDε-ΟΕ on leaf size was greater under nitrogen-deficient than -sufficient condition. Under nitrogen deficiency, AtPLDε-OE soybean plants had a higher chlorophyll content and activity of nitrogen assimilation-related enzymes than wild-type soybean plants. AtPLDε-OE led to a higher level of specific PA species in roots after rhizobium inoculation than wild type. AtPLDε-OE soybean plants also increased seed production under nitrogen deprivation with and without nodulation and decreased seed germination in response to high humidity storage and artificial aging. These results suggest that PLDε promotes nitrogen response and affects adversely seed viability during storage.",cc-by-4.0,,,

However, little is known about these membrane-cytoskeleton interfaces and related genes. Here, we report the roles of a major root phospholipase D (PLD), PLDα1, and its enzymatic product, phosphatidic acid (PA), in rhizobium-root interaction and nodulation. PLDα1 was activated and the PA content transiently increased in roots after rhizobial infection. Levels of PLDα1 transcript and PA, as well as actin and tubulin cytoskeleton-related gene expression, changed markedly during root-rhizobium interactions and nodule development. Pre-treatment of the roots of soybean seedlings with n-butanol suppressed the generation of PLD-derived PA, the expression of early nodulation genes and nodule numbers. Overexpression or knockdown of GmPLDα1 resulted in changes in PA levels, glycerolipid profiles, nodule numbers, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, early nodulation gene expression and hormone levels upon rhizobial infection compared with GUS roots. The transcript levels of cytoskeleton-related genes, such as GmACTIN, GmTUBULIN, actin capping protein 1 (GmCP1) and microtubule-associating protein (GmMAP1), were modified in GmPLDα1-altered hairy roots compared with those of GUS roots. Phosphatidic acid physically bound to GmCP1 and GmMAP1, which could be related to cytoskeletal changes in rhizobium-infected GmPLDα1 mutant roots.

Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DAG) to generate phosphatidic acid (PA), and both DAG and PA are lipid mediators in the cell. Here we show that DGK1 in rice (Oryza sativa) plays important roles in root growth and development.

Two independent OsDGK1‐knockout (dgk1) lines exhibited a higher density of lateral roots (LRs) and thinner seminal roots (SRs), whereas OsDGK1‐overexpressing plants displayed a lower LR density and thicker SRs than wild‐type (WT) plants.

Overexpression of OsDGK1 led to a decline in the DGK substrate DAG whereas specific PA species decreased in dgk1 roots. Supplementation of DAG to OsDGK1‐overexpressing seedlings restored the LR density and SR thickness whereas application of PA to dgk1 seedlings restored the LR density and SR thickness to those of the WT. In addition, treatment of rice seedlings with the DGK inhibitor R59022 increased the level of DAG and decreased PA, which also restored the root phenotype of OsDGK1‐overexpressing seedlings close to that of the WT.

Together, these results indicate that DGK1 and associated lipid mediators modulate rice root architecture; DAG promotes LR formation and suppresses SR growth whereas PA suppresses LR number and promotes SR thickness.

Soybean WRINKLED1 (WRI1) a and b, with their alternative splicing (AS) products a' and b', are highly expressed in developing seeds and nodules, but their functions in soybean nodulation are not known. GmWRI1a and b differently promoted triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in both Arabidopsis wild-type and wri1 mutant seeds and when they ectopically expressed in the soybean hairy roots. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 15 genes containing AW boxes in their promoters were targeted by GmWRI1s, including genes involved in glycolysis, fatty acid (FA) and TAG biosynthesis. GmWRI1a, GmWRI1b and b' differentially transactivated most targeted genes. Overexpression of GmWRI1s affected phospholipid and galactolipid synthesis, soluble sugar and starch contents and led to increased nodule numbers, whereas GmWRI1 knockdown hairy roots interfered root glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis and resulted in fewer nodules. These phenomena in GmWRI1 mutants coincided with the altered expression of nodulation genes. Thus, GmWRI1-regulated starch degradation, glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis were critical for nodulation. GmWRI1 mutants also altered auxin and other hormone-related biosynthesis and hormone-related genes, by which GmWRI1s may affect nodule development.

This shortcoming has led to the decrease, rather than an increase in the performance of classifying compounds when more structures are added to the ensemble. Previously, we suggested machine learning, implemented in the form of a naïve Bayesian model could alleviate this problem. However, the naïve Bayesian model assumed that the probabilities of observing the docking scores to different structures to be independent. This approximation might prevent it from achieving even higher performance. In the work presented in this paper, we have relaxed this approximation when using several other machine learning methods—k nearest neighbor, logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest—to improve ensemble docking.

Previous studies have also found that the performance of classification could decrease rather than increase with the number of structures included in the ensemble.

In this study of intercollegiate athletes from diverse sports (N = 713), we examined MD in relation to other character-related variables: empathy, moral identity, moral attentiveness, and contesting orientations. We also examined whether moral attentiveness conforms to the pattern of “bracketed morality” found in moral reasoning (Shields &amp; Bredemeier, 1995) and moral behavior (Kavussanu, Boardley, Sagar, &amp; Ring, 2013). Results indicated that MD correlated positively with perceptual moral attentiveness and war contesting orientation; MD correlated negatively with empathy, moral identity, reflective moral attentiveness, and partnership contesting orientation. Results of hierarchical regression demonstrated that gender, contesting orientations, moral identity, and one form of moral attentiveness were significant predictors of MD. Finally, sport participants were found to be less morally attentive in sport than in everyday life.",,,,

These two alternate metaphors suggest differing sociomoral relationships among the participants. In the current study of intercollegiate athletes (n = 610), we investigated the two approaches to contesting in relation to formalist and consequentialist moral frameworks (Brady &amp; Wheeler, 1996) and individualizing and binding moral foundations (Haidt, 2001). Correlational analysis indicated that the partnership approach correlated significantly with all four moral dimensions, while the war approach correlated with formalist and consequentialist frameworks and binding foundations (i.e., appeals to in-group loyalty, authority, and purity). Multiple regressions demonstrated that the best predictors of a partnership approach were formalist thinking and endorsement of individualizing moral foundations (i.e., appeal to fairness and welfare).

In recent decades it has been retold and reimagined so many times that the tale has become an iconic narrative in the context of the reassessment of Descartes's significance in intellectual history. But a close reading of the original story, found in a 1699 work entitledMélanges d'histoire et de littératureby Vigneul-Marville, reveals an overtly stated agenda of saving the philosopher's moral reputation, which makes most recent interpretations of the story problematic. The vast majority of modern retellings demonstrate no awareness of the content or the significance of the first tale even as it has been used to shed light on Descartes, Cartesian ideas, and early modern thought in general.",,,,

How so, for whom, with what impact? Scholars have productively pursued two scales of analysis: grassroots and geopolitical. While student movements have been the premier instance of the more socio-cultural scale, seldom has their mobilization been analyzed vis-à-vis the ostensibly more macro scale of supra-state entitie. Intermediaries between these sectors, leaders of major universities occupied an acutely uncomfortable, pivotal place. Through historical analysis based on archival research (on the biographies of university administrators, student movements, and media debates) the Global 1968 is here considered from the perspective of higher education administrators at elite universities of capitalist empire in the mid-twentieth century at metropoles/global cities – London and New York – and semi-periphery nodes – Bloomington (Indiana, USA) and Mexico City. For such elites, consternation over the turmoil of 1968 constituted a kind of global moral panic when universities presidents found themselves the objects of intense pressures on multiple fronts: from students, to relinquish much authority, and at the same time, from fellow elites and much of the public, to forcefully discipline students. In juxtaposing brief biographies of these university presidents, we highlight the experiences and visions of the global that these men brought to the table, in relation to the pressures that they faced from student movements on their campuses as well as from political powers and the general public. These multi-scaler pressures constituted 1968 as a global phenomenon and put administrators squarely on this conjunctural hot seat.",cc-by-nc,,,

The radiative lifetimes are similar for all structures, while the nonradiative lifetimes decrease as the well width decreases. The superior IQE and longer nonradiative lifetime of the SQW structure suggests using thick SQW active regions for high brightness semipolar (202¯1¯) LEDs.",cc-by,29519065.0,,

In addition, the fatty acyl composition of the oil was determined by gas chromatography (GC) after hydrolyzing the triacylglycerides in the oil and esterifying the fatty acids produced. The density, refractive index, iodine index and saponification number for cocoplum seed oil were 0.9278 g•mL-1, 1.508, 107 gI2•100 g-1 and 180 mg KOH•g-1, respectively. The seeds contained potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, iron, manganese, zinc and copper at concentrations of 340, 93.4, 30, 173, 2.9, 0.8, 0.8 and 0.67 mg•g-1, respectively. They also contained 24.9 g•100 g-1 of total carbohydrates. This included 19.8 and 0.07 g•100 g-1 of insoluble and soluble fiber. The seed oil was found to contain triacylglycerides with a large amount of unsaturated fats, including conjugated linoleic fatty acyls. GC analysis of the hydrolyzed fats indicated the presence of palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids in the hydrolysate.https://doi.org/10.21423/jrs-v05n02p015 (DOI assigned 3/11/2019)",cc-by-nc-4.0,,,

Synthetic modifications can improve PA-DNA binding affinity and include flexible modules, such as β-alanine (β) motifs to replace pyrroles (Py), and increasing compound charge using N-terminal cationic substituents. To better understand the variations in kinetics and affinities caused by these modifications on PA-DNA interactions, a comprehensive set of PAs with different numbers and positions of β and different types of N-cationic groups was systematically designed and synthesized to bind their cognate sequence, the λB motif. The λB motif is also a strong binding promoter site of the major groove targeting transcription factor PU.1. The PA binding affinities and kinetics were evaluated using a spectrum of powerful biophysical methods: thermal melting, biosensor surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism. The results show that β inserts affect PA-DNA interactions in a number and position dependent manner. Specifically, a β replacement between two imidazole heterocycles (ImβIm) generally strengthens binding. In addition, N-terminal cationic groups can accelerate the association between PA and DNA, but the bulky size of TMG can cause steric hindrance and unfavourable repulsive electrostatic interactions in some PAs. The future design of stronger binding PA requires careful combination of βs and cationic substituents.",,29143012.0,"['Cations', 'Nylons', 'beta-Alanine', 'DNA', 'Binding Sites']",PMC5763910

But mental processes such as reasoning and learning seem to be possible in the absence of phenomenal consciousness. It is difficult to pinpoint in what way phenomenal consciousness enhances these processes or others like them. In this paper, we explore a possibility that has been neglected to date. Perhaps phenomenal consciousness has no function of its own because it is either a by-product of other traits or a (functionless) accident.

Neurorobot.,Frontiers Media SA,,16,,2022-04-14,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering']","Situated approaches to cognition maintain that cognition is embodied, embedded, enactive, and affective (and extended, but that is not relevant here). Situated approaches are often pitched as alternatives to computational and representational approaches, according to which cognition is computation over representations. I argue that, far from being opposites, situatedness and neural representation are more deeply intertwined than anyone suspected. To show this, I introduce a neurocomputational account of cognition that relies on neural representations. I argue not only that this account is compatible with (non-question-begging) situated approaches, but also that it requires embodiment, embeddedness, enaction, and affect at its very core. That is, constructing neural representations and their semantic content, and learning computational processes appropriate for their content, requires a tight dynamic interaction between nervous system, body, and environment. Most importantly, I argue that situatedness is needed to give a satisfactory account of neural representation: neurocognitive systems that are embodied, embedded, affective, dynamically interact with their environment, and use feedback from their interaction to shape their own representations and computations (1) can construct neural representations with original semantic content, (2) their neural vehicles and the way they are processed are automatically coordinated with their content, (3) such content is causally efficacious, (4) is determinate enough for the system's purposes, (5) represents the distal stimulus, and (6) can misrepresent.

Similarly, higher-level properties are neither identical to nor (completely) distinct from their lower-level realizers. Instead, higher-level properties are aspects of their realizers that are invariant under some transformations in their realizers. Nowhere in this picture is there any ontological hierarchy between levels of composition or realization. Neither wholes nor their parts are more fundamental. Neither is prior.

               Knowledge is factually grounded belief. This account uses the same ingredients as the traditional analysis—belief, truth, and justification—but posits a different relation between them. While the traditional analysis begins with true belief and improves it by simply adding justification, this account begins with belief, improves it by grounding it, and then improves it further by grounding it in the facts. In other words, for a belief to be knowledge, it's not enough that it be true and justified; for a belief to be knowledge, it must be justified by the facts. This account solves the Gettier problem. Gettierized beliefs fall short of knowledge because, albeit true and justified, they are not grounded in the facts. This account also elucidates why knowledge attributions are sensitive to epistemic standards. It's because whether we take a belief to be grounded in the facts is sensitive to epistemic standards.",,,,

The interacting ATPases PEX1 and PEX6 contribute to peroxisome function by recycling PEX5, a cytosolic receptor needed to import proteins targeted to the peroxisomal matrix. <i>Arabidopsis pex6</i> mutants exhibit low PEX5 levels and defects in peroxisomal matrix protein import, oil body utilization, peroxisomal metabolism, and seedling growth. These defects are hypothesized to stem from impaired PEX5 retrotranslocation leading to PEX5 polyubiquitination and consequent degradation of PEX5 via the proteasome or of the entire organelle via autophagy. We recovered a <i>pex1</i> missense mutation in a screen for second-site suppressors that restore growth to the <i>pex6-1</i> mutant. Surprisingly, this <i>pex1-1</i> mutation ameliorated the metabolic and physiological defects of <i>pex6-1</i> without restoring PEX5 levels. Similarly, preventing autophagy by introducing an <i>atg7</i>-null allele partially rescued <i>pex6-1</i> physiological defects without restoring PEX5 levels. <i>atg7</i> synergistically improved matrix protein import in <i>pex1-1 pex6-1</i>, implying that <i>pex1-1</i> improves peroxisome function in <i>pex6-1</i> without impeding autophagy of peroxisomes (i.e., pexophagy). <i>pex1-1</i> differentially improved peroxisome function in various <i>pex6</i> alleles but worsened the physiological and molecular defects of a <i>pex26</i> mutant, which is defective in the tether anchoring the PEX1-PEX6 hexamer to the peroxisome. Our results support the hypothesis that, beyond PEX5 recycling, PEX1 and PEX6 have additional functions in peroxisome homeostasis and perhaps in oil body utilization.",,29555730.0,"['peroxisome', 'Peroxin', 'Pexophagy', 'Oil Bodies', 'Aaa Atpase', 'Peroxisomes', 'Arabidopsis', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Protein Transport', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Autophagy', 'Ubiquitination', 'ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities', 'Peroxisome-Targeting Signal 1 Receptor', 'peroxisome-targeting signal 1 receptor', 'PEX5 protein, Arabidopsis', 'PEROXIN6 protein, Arabidopsis', 'PEX1 protein, Arabidopsis']",PMC5889664
Long chain acyl CoA synthetase 4 catalyzes the first step in peroxisomal indole-3-butyric acid to IAA conversion,2021.0,"[{'given': 'Vanessica', 'family': 'Jawahir', 'name': 'Vanessica Jawahir'}, {'given': 'Bethany Karlin', 'family': 'Zolman', 'name': 'Bethany Karlin Zolman'}]",Plant Physiology,10.1093/plphys/kiaa002,journal-article,"['0032-0889', '1532-2548']",,,Oxford University Press (OUP),1,185,120-136,2021-02-25,"['Plant Science', 'Genetics', 'Physiology']","Abstract
               Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) is an endogenous storage auxin important for maintaining appropriate indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels, thereby influencingprimary root elongation and lateral root development. IBA is metabolized into free IAA in peroxisomes in a multistep process similar to fatty acid β-oxidation. We identified LONG CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE 4 (LACS4) in a screen for enhanced IBA resistance in primary root elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana. LACSs activate substrates by catalyzing the addition of CoA, the necessary first step for fatty acids to participate in β-oxidation or other metabolic pathways. Here, we describe the novel role of LACS4 in hormone metabolism and postulate that LACS4 catalyzes the addition of CoA onto IBA, the first step in its β-oxidation. lacs4 is resistant to the effects of IBA in primary root elongation and dark-grown hypocotyl elongation, and has reduced lateral root density. lacs6 also is resistant to IBA, although both lacs4 and lacs6 remain sensitive to IAA in primary root elongation, demonstrating that auxin responses are intact. LACS4 has in vitro enzymatic activity on IBA, but not IAA or IAA conjugates, and disruption of LACS4 activity reduces the amount of IBA-derived IAA in planta. We conclude that, in addition to activity on fatty acids, LACS4 and LACS6 also catalyze the addition of CoA onto IBA, the first step in IBA metabolism and a necessary step in generating IBA-derived IAA.",cc-by-4.0,,,

               In this glossary of plant cell structures, we asked experts to summarize a present-day view of plant organelles and structures, including a discussion of outstanding questions. In the following short reviews, the authors discuss the complexities of the plant cell endomembrane system, exciting connections between organelles, novel insights into peroxisome structure and function, dynamics of mitochondria, and the mysteries that need to be unlocked from the plant cell wall. These discussions are focused through a lens of new microscopy techniques. Advanced imaging has uncovered unexpected shapes, dynamics, and intricate membrane formations. With a continued focus in the next decade, these imaging modalities coupled with functional studies are sure to begin to unravel mysteries of the plant cell.",,,,

These provided essential data for mission planning, large-scale context information for the coma and tails beyond the spacecraft and a way to directly compare 67P with other comets. The observations revealed 67P to be a relatively 'well-behaved' comet, typical of Jupiter family comets and with activity patterns that repeat from orbit to orbit. Comparison between this large collection of telescopic observations and the in situ results from Rosetta will allow us to better understand comet coma chemistry and structure.

               A major upgrade to the NIRSPEC instrument at the Keck II telescope was successfully completed in time for near-infrared spectroscopic observations of comet 46P/Wirtanen during its exceptionally close flyby of Earth in 2018 December. These studies determined the abundances of several volatiles, including C2H2, C2H6, CH3OH, NH3, HCN, H2CO, and H2O. Long-slit spatial distributions of gas rotational temperature and column density are diagnostic for the presence of icy grains in the coma and understanding if different volatiles are associated with common or distinct outgassing sources. These spatial distributions suggest that C2H2, C2H6, and HCN have a common outgassing source, whereas H2O and CH3OH have additional, more extended sources. The synergy of these findings with observations by space missions (Rosetta and EPOXI) motivates continuing studies to address whether or not C2H6, C2H2, and HCN have a common source of release (plausibly associated with CO2) in a larger sample of comets and whether systematic differences exist in the release of these species compared to H2O and CH3OH. Abundances of volatiles are reported relative to H2O, as traditionally done, as well as C2H6. While not unique, the choice of C2H6 demonstrates the value of extending the chemical taxonomy of parent volatiles in comets toward additional compositional “baselines” and, importantly, closer integration between coma abundances and the underlying volatile associations as revealed by spatial distributions.

               The exceptionally favorable close approach of Jupiter-family comet 46P/Wirtanen in 2018 December enabled characterization of its primary volatile composition with exceptionally high spatial resolution and sensitivities using the iSHELL spectrograph at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on Maunakea, HI. We sampled emissions from H2O, HCN, C2H2, NH3, C2H6, and CH3OH on UT 2018 December 21 using two instrumental settings that spanned the 2.9–3.6 μm spectral region. We also obtained a sensitive 3σ upper limit for H2CO and for the rarely studied molecule HC3N. We report rotational temperatures, production rates, and mixing ratios (relative to H2O as well as to C2H6). We place our results in context by comparing them with other comets observed at near-IR wavelengths. We also compare our results with those obtained using the NIRSPEC-2 spectrograph on Keck II on UT December 17 and 18 and with results obtained from iSHELL on other dates during the same apparition. Within 1–2σ uncertainty, production rates obtained for all molecules in this work were consistent with those obtained using NIRSPEC-2 except H2O, indicating low-level variability on a timescale of days. Mixing ratios with respect to H2O in 46P/Wirtanen were consistent with corresponding values from NIRSPEC-2 within the uncertainty with the exception of CH3OH, which yielded a higher ratio on December 21. Our measurements afforded a high temporal resolution that spanned ∼2/3 of the rotational period of 46P/Wirtanen, enabling us to test short-term variability in the production rates of H2O and HCN due to rotational effects. Both H2O and HCN production rates showed similar temporal variability, resulting in nearly constant HCN/H2O.",cc-by-4.0,,,

               We present analysis of IR and optical spectroscopy of Jupiter-family comet (JFC) 46P/Wirtanen obtained in 2019 January, when the comet had sufficient geocentric velocity to enable studies of the hypervolatiles CO and CH4, as well as [O i] emission. These species could not be studied near closest approach in mid-December because there was insufficient Doppler shift to separate the cometary emission from their corresponding telluric absorption lines. We employed the [O i] observations as a proxy for the CO2/H2O ratio, as CO2 cannot be observed directly from the ground, and space-based assets sensitive to CO2 were not able to observe 46P during this apparition. We focused our analysis on H2O, CO, CH4, C2H6, CH3OH, and CO2 (via [O i] emission). We detected strong emissions from H2O, C2H6, and CH3OH. Over the 3 nights, we found evidence for changing mixing ratios, mostly due to a variable H2O production rate. In 46P, C2H6 and CH3OH are enriched compared to cometary averages, with mixing ratios relative to H2O of ∼1% and ∼3%, respectively. Measurements of CH4 and CO have been especially rare in JFCs. We report significant 3σ upper limits on CH4/H2O &lt; 0.97% and CO/H2O &lt; 0.54%. They place CH4 being near-average or depleted, and CO being strongly depleted in 46P compared with Oort cloud comets. 46P has comparable CO/H2O to the few other measurements in JFCs, but enriched in C2H6 and CH3OH. Our inferred CO2/H2O mixing ratio is ∼15%, though accounting for systematic uncertainties from the lack of knowledge of [O i] photochemistry means a value between 10% and 20% is likely. The compositional profile of 46P is similar to another small, hyperactive comet: 103P/Hartley 2. The mechanism of CO2-driven water-rich ice grain production proposed for 103P/Hartley 2 may be operating on 46P as well.",cc-by-4.0,,,

               The 2018 perihelion passage of comet 46P/Wirtanen afforded an opportunity to measure the abundances and spatial distributions of coma volatiles in a Jupiter-family comet with exceptional spatial resolution for several weeks surrounding its closest approach to Earth (Δmin ∼0.078 au on UT December 16). We conducted near-infrared spectroscopic observations of 46P/Wirtanen using iSHELL at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on UT 2018 December 18 in direct coordination with observations using the newly upgraded NIRSPEC-2 instrument at the W. M. Keck Observatory, and securely detected fluorescent emission from CH3OH, C2H6, and H2O. This coordinated campaign utilizing the two premier near-infrared facilities in the northern hemisphere enabled us to sample distinct projections of the coma into the plane of the sky simultaneously, and provided an unprecedented view into the inner coma of 46P/Wirtanen near closest approach. We report rotational temperatures, production rates, and abundance ratios (i.e., mixing ratios) for all sampled species and compare our iSHELL results to simultaneous (or near-simultaneous) measurements taken with NIRSPEC-2. We demonstrate the extraordinary synergy of coordinated measurements using iSHELL and NIRSPEC-2, and advocate for future cometary studies that jointly leverage the capabilities of these two facilities.",cc-by-4.0,,,

               High-resolution infrared spectra of comet C/2014 Q2 Lovejoy were acquired with NIRSPEC at the W. M. Keck Observatory on two post-perihelion dates (UT 2015 February 2 and 3). H2O was measured simultaneously with CO, CH3OH, H2CO, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C2H2, HCN, and NH3 on both dates, and rotational temperatures, production rates, relative abundances, H2O ortho-to-para ratios, and spatial distributions in the coma were determined. The first detection of C2H4 in a comet from ground-based observations is reported. Abundances relative to H2O for all species were found to be in the typical range compared with values for other comets in the overall population to date. There is evidence of variability in rotational temperatures and production rates on timescales that are small compared with the rotational period of the comet. Spatial distributions of volatiles in the coma suggest complex outgassing behavior. CH3OH, HCN, C2H6, and CH4 spatial distributions in the coma are consistent with direct release from associated ices in the nucleus and are peaked in a more sunward direction compared with co-measured dust. H2O spatial profiles are clearly distinct from these other four species, likely due to a sizable coma contribution from icy grain sublimation. Spatial distributions for C2H2, H2CO, and NH3 suggest substantial contributions from extended coma sources, providing further evidence for distinct origins and associations for these species in comets. CO shows a different spatial distribution compared with other volatiles, consistent with jet activity from discrete nucleus ice sources.",cc-by-4.0,,,

        A number of studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) report thinner cerebral cortical gyri using gyrus-based analysis or thinner foci within the gyri using vertex-based analysis. However, the locations of these findings are inconsistent across studies, and the spatial transformations required during vertex-based analysis may affect the focal findings. A mega-analysis using a large number of subjects from multiple PTSD studies could potentially identify more reproducible cortical thickness abnormalities. Investigating both the vertex and gyral thicknesses simultaneously may verify the vertex-based focal findings using gyral data without imposing any spatial transformation. Here we aggregated data from 24 international laboratories using ENIGMA standardized procedures for 949 adult PTSD patients and 1493 controls without PTSD (age 18 to 65 years). We examined whether gyral and vertex cortical thickness are (a) different between subjects with PTSD and controls and (b) associated with PTSD symptom severity in trauma-exposed subjects. Regions with overlapping thinner cortical gyri and thinner vertex clusters were located in frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices. Thinner right lateral orbitofrontal and right lingual gyri and concomitantly thinner vertex clusters in the anterior portions of both gyri were associated with PTSD symptom severity. Convergent findings in these locations suggest focally thinner cortex in these gyri, which may be involved in altered processing and regulation of emotion and sensory inputs underlying posttraumatic stress symptoms.",cc-by-4.0,,,

	    Background
	    Several hypotheses may explain the association between substance use, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. However, few studies have utilized a large multisite dataset to understand this complex relationship. Our study assessed the relationship between alcohol and cannabis use trajectories and PTSD and depression symptoms across 3 months in recently trauma-exposed civilians.
	  
	  
	    Methods
	    In total, 1618 (1037 female) participants provided self-report data on past 30-day alcohol and cannabis use and PTSD and depression symptoms during their emergency department (baseline) visit. We reassessed participant's substance use and clinical symptoms 2, 8, and 12 weeks posttrauma. Latent class mixture modeling determined alcohol and cannabis use trajectories in the sample. Changes in PTSD and depression symptoms were assessed across alcohol and cannabis use trajectories via a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance.
	  
	  
	    Results
	    Three trajectory classes (low, high, increasing use) provided the best model fit for alcohol and cannabis use. The low alcohol use class exhibited lower PTSD symptoms at baseline than the high use class; the low cannabis use class exhibited lower PTSD and depression symptoms at baseline than the high and increasing use classes; these symptoms greatly increased at week 8 and declined at week 12. Participants who already use alcohol and cannabis exhibited greater PTSD and depression symptoms at baseline that increased at week 8 with a decrease in symptoms at week 12.
	  
	  
	    Conclusions
	    Our findings suggest that alcohol and cannabis use trajectories are associated with the intensity of posttrauma psychopathology. These findings could potentially inform the timing of therapeutic strategies.

Pain, depression, avoidance of trauma reminders, reexperiencing trauma, anxiety, hyperarousal, sleep disruption, and nightmares have been reported. Wrist-wearable devices with accelerometers capable of assessing 24-hour rest-activity characteristics are prevalent and may have utility in measuring these outcomes.ObjectiveTo evaluate whether wrist-wearable devices can provide useful biomarkers for recovery after traumatic stress exposure.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsData were analyzed from a diverse cohort of individuals seen in the emergency department after experiencing a traumatic stress exposure, as part of the Advancing Understanding of Recovery After Trauma (AURORA) study. Participants recruited from 27 emergency departments wore wrist-wearable devices for 8 weeks, beginning in the emergency department, and completed serial assessments of neuropsychiatric symptoms. A total of 19 019 patients were screened. Of these, 3040 patients met study criteria, provided informed consent, and completed baseline assessments. A total of 2021 provided data from wrist-wearable devices, completed the 8-week assessment, and were included in this analysis. The data were randomly divided into 2 equal parts (n = 1010) for biomarker identification and validation. Data were collected from September 2017 to January 2020, and data were analyzed from May 2020 to November 2022.ExposuresParticipants were recruited for the study after experiencing a traumatic stress exposure (most commonly motor vehicle collision).Main Outcomes and MeasuresRest-activity characteristics were derived and validated from wrist-wearable devices associated with specific self-reported symptom domains at a point in time and changes in symptom severity over time.ResultsOf 2021 included patients, 1257 (62.2%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 35.8 (13.0) years. Eight wrist-wearable device biomarkers for symptoms of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae exceeded significance thresholds in the derivation cohort. One of these, reduced 24-hour activity variance, was associated with greater pain severity (r = −0.14; 95% CI, −0.20 to −0.07). Changes in 6 rest-activity measures were associated with changes in pain over time, and changes in the number of transitions between sleep and wake over time were associated with changes in pain, sleep, and anxiety. Simple cutoffs for these biomarkers identified individuals with good recovery for pain (positive predictive value [PPV], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82-0.88), sleep (PPV, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.59-0.67, and anxiety (PPV, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72-0.80) with high predictive value.Conclusions and RelevanceThese findings suggest that wrist-wearable device biomarkers may have utility as screening tools for pain, sleep, and anxiety symptom outcomes after trauma exposure in high-risk populations.",,,,

	    Aims
	    Childhood adversities (CAs) predict heightened risks of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive episode (MDE) among people exposed to adult traumatic events. Identifying which CAs put individuals at greatest risk for these adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS) is important for targeting prevention interventions.
	  
	  
	    Methods
	    Data came from n = 999 patients ages 18–75 presenting to 29 U.S. emergency departments after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and followed for 3 months, the amount of time traditionally used to define chronic PTSD, in the Advancing Understanding of Recovery After Trauma (AURORA) study. Six CA types were self-reported at baseline: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect and bullying. Both dichotomous measures of ever experiencing each CA type and numeric measures of exposure frequency were included in the analysis. Risk ratios (RRs) of these CA measures as well as complex interactions among these measures were examined as predictors of APNS 3 months post-MVC. APNS was defined as meeting self-reported criteria for either PTSD based on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and/or MDE based on the PROMIS Depression Short-Form 8b. We controlled for pre-MVC lifetime histories of PTSD and MDE. We also examined mediating effects through peritraumatic symptoms assessed in the emergency department and PTSD and MDE assessed in 2-week and 8-week follow-up surveys. Analyses were carried out with robust Poisson regression models.
	  
	  
	    Results
	    Most participants (90.9%) reported at least rarely having experienced some CA. Ever experiencing each CA other than emotional neglect was univariably associated with 3-month APNS (RRs = 1.31–1.60). Each CA frequency was also univariably associated with 3-month APNS (RRs = 1.65–2.45). In multivariable models, joint associations of CAs with 3-month APNS were additive, with frequency of emotional abuse (RR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.43–2.87) and bullying (RR = 1.44; 95% CI = 0.99–2.10) being the strongest predictors. Control variable analyses found that these associations were largely explained by pre-MVC histories of PTSD and MDE.
	  
	  
	    Conclusions
	    Although individuals who experience frequent emotional abuse and bullying in childhood have a heightened risk of experiencing APNS after an adult MVC, these associations are largely mediated by prior histories of PTSD and MDE.

More than two thousand MVC survivors were enrolled in the emergency department (ED) and completed a rotating battery of brief smartphone-based surveys over a 2-month period. Measurement models developed from survey item responses were used in latent growth curve/mixture modeling to characterize homogeneous symptom trajectories. Associations between individual trajectories and pre-trauma and peritraumatic characteristics and traditional outcomes were compared, along with associations within and between trajectories. APNS across all ten symptom domains were common in the first two months after trauma. Many risk factors and associations with high symptom burden trajectories were shared across domains. Both across and within traditional diagnostic boundaries, APNS trajectory intercepts, and slopes were substantially correlated. Across all domains, symptom severity in the immediate aftermath of trauma (trajectory intercepts) had the greatest influence on the outcome. An interactive data visualization tool was developed to allow readers to explore relationships of interest between individual characteristics, symptom trajectories, and traditional outcomes (http://itr.med.unc.edu/aurora/parcoord/). Individuals presenting to the ED after MVC commonly experience a broad constellation of adverse posttraumatic symptoms. Many risk factors for diverse APNS are shared. Individuals diagnosed with a single traditional outcome should be screened for others. The utility of multidimensional categorizations that characterize individuals across traditional diagnostic domains should be explored.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Theory has suggested that in individuals with PTSD, rumination serves as a cognitive avoidance factor that contributes to the maintenance of symptoms by inhibiting the cognitive and emotional processing of the traumatic event, subsequently interfering with treatment engagement and outcome. Little is known about the neural correlates of rumination in women with PTSD. The current study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural correlates during an emotion interference task of self‐reported rumination in women with PTSD. Women with PTSD (39 participants) were recruited at a university‐based trauma clinic and completed a clinical evaluation that included measures of PTSD symptoms, rumination, and depressive symptoms, as well as a neuroimaging session in which the participants were administered an emotion interference task. There was a significant relationship between self‐reported rumination and activity in the right orbital frontal cortex, BA 11; t(37) = 5.62, p = .004, k = 46 during the task. This finding suggested that women with PTSD, who had higher levels of rumination, may experience greater difficulty inhibiting negative emotional stimuli compared to women with lower levels of rumination.",,,,

Limited work to date, however, has investigated potential racial/ethnic variability in amygdala reactivity or connectivity that may in turn be related to outcomes such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants from the AURORA study (n = 283), a multisite longitudinal study of trauma outcomes, completed functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysiology within approximately two-weeks of trauma exposure. Seed-based amygdala connectivity and amygdala reactivity during passive viewing of fearful and neutral faces were assessed during fMRI. Physiological activity was assessed during Pavlovian threat conditioning. Participants also reported the severity of posttraumatic symptoms 3 and 6 months after trauma. Black individuals showed lower baseline skin conductance levels and startle compared to White individuals, but no differences were observed in physiological reactions to threat. Further, Hispanic and Black participants showed greater amygdala connectivity to regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and cerebellum compared to White participants. No differences were observed in amygdala reactivity to threat. Amygdala connectivity was associated with 3-month PTSD symptoms, but the associations differed by racial/ethnic group and were partly driven by group differences in structural inequities. The present findings suggest variability in tonic neurophysiological arousal in the early aftermath of trauma between racial/ethnic groups, driven by structural inequality, impacts neural processes that mediate susceptibility to later PTSD symptoms.",cc-by-4.0,,,

We documented and analyzed the perspectives of mental health therapists in the context of a randomized control trial (RCT) intervention within the Mekong Project in Cambodia. The research questions explored perceptions of therapists’ care of mental health clients, therapist well-being, and experiences of navigating within a research environment in which SGM citizens with mental health concerns receive treatment. The larger study enrolled 150 Cambodian adults, among which 69 identified as SGM. Three key patterns emerged across our interpretations. Clients seek help when symptoms interfere with daily life, therapists care for clients and themselves, and integrated research and practice is integral yet sometimes paradoxical. Therapists did not identify differences in terms of how they work with SGM clients compared with non-SGM clients. Future studies are warranted to examine a reciprocal academic-research partnership in which we examine therapists’ work alongside rural community members, evaluate the process of embedding and fortifying peer supports within educational systems, and study the wisdom of traditional and Buddhist healers to address the discrimination and violence that citizens who identify as SGM disproportionately suffer.

Specifically, premature termination and treatment response limit the effectiveness of these interventions. The current study investigated factors potentially related to premature termination and treatment response in Cognitive Processing Therapy with Account (CPT-A). Participants in this study included 42 women ( Mage = 30.70 SDage = 9.40) with PTSD from exposure to interpersonal trauma. Demographic characteristics, pre-treatment symptoms of PTSD and depression, and transdiagnostic factors were examined as predictors of attrition and treatment response. Hierarchical regression and logistic regression models were analyzed to test the variance explained and predictive value of these factors. The present study revealed that age was a significant factor related to dropout from CPT-A whereas baseline PTSD symptom severity was significantly related to treatment response. Results of this study suggest the importance of the interrelationships among pre-treatment predictors as well as the consideration of attrition and treatment response as distinct metrics of treatment outcome. Further, these results inform the application of CPT-A for PTSD in survivors of interpersonal trauma, as consideration of the identified predictors of dropout and non-response at intake may contribute to treatment retention and response.

A neurocircuitry model supporting fronto-limbic dysfunction as a major player in facilitating clinical symptoms of PTSD is well-characterized; however, recent literature suggests that network-based approaches may provide additional insight into neural dysfunction in PTSD. Our analysis uses resting-state neuroimaging scans of 1063 adults from the PGC-ENIGMA PTSD Consortium to investigate a network-based model of functional connectivity in PTSD. With a novel, resolution limit-free community detection approach, 16 communities corresponding to functionally meaningful networks were detected with high quality. After group-level community detection, participants were classified into three groups (PTSD, n=418, trauma-exposed controls without PTSD, n=434, and non-trauma exposed healthy controls, n=211). Individual network connectivity metrics were calculated, including whole-brain, default mode network, and central executive network participation coefficient and connectivity strength. Linear mixed effects models revealed group differences in the whole-brain, default mode, and central executive network participation coefficient and connectivity strength such that individuals with PTSD demonstrated overall greater values. We also described sex differences such that males demonstrate greater whole-brain participation coefficient vs. females and females demonstrate greater default mode network connectivity strength vs. males. Our results suggest that PTSD in adults is associated with reduced specialization and enhanced inter-module communication throughout the brain network, which may contribute to inefficient information processing and poor emotional regulation. This study presents a novel use of resolution limit-free community detection in a large PTSD sample, revealing robust differences in resting-state network topology.",cc-by-nc-nd,,,

However, limited research has investigated the impact of childhood trauma on brain structure linked to later posttraumatic dysfunction. We investigated the effect of childhood trauma on white matter microstructure after recent trauma and its relationship with future posttraumatic dysfunction among trauma-exposed adult participants (n = 202) recruited from emergency departments as part of the AURORA Study. Participants completed self-report scales assessing prior childhood maltreatment within 2-weeks in addition to assessments of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and dissociation symptoms within 6-months of their traumatic event. Fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) collected at 2-weeks and 6-months was used to index white matter microstructure. Childhood maltreatment load predicted 6-month PTSD symptoms (b = 1.75, SE = 0.78, 95% CI = [0.20, 3.29]) and inversely varied with FA in the bilateral internal capsule (IC) at 2-weeks (p = 0.0294, FDR corrected) and 6-months (p = 0.0238, FDR corrected). We observed a significant indirect effect of childhood maltreatment load on 6-month PTSD symptoms through 2-week IC microstructure (b = 0.37, Boot SE = 0.18, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.76]) that fully mediated the effect of childhood maltreatment load on PCL-5 scores (b = 1.37, SE = 0.79, 95% CI = [−0.18, 2.93]). IC microstructure did not mediate relationships between childhood maltreatment and depressive, anxiety, or dissociative symptomatology. Our findings suggest a unique role for IC microstructure as a stable neural pathway between childhood trauma and future PTSD symptoms following recent trauma. Notably, our work did not support roles of white matter tracts previously found to vary with PTSD symptoms and childhood trauma exposure, including the cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, and corpus callosum. Given the IC contains sensory fibers linked to perception and motor control, childhood maltreatment might impact the neural circuits that relay and process threat-related inputs and responses to trauma.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Objective
Whether short-term, low-potency opioid prescriptions for acute pain lead to future at-risk opioid use remains controversial and inadequately characterized. Our objective was to measure the association between emergency department (ED) opioid analgesic exposure after a physical, trauma-related event and subsequent opioid use. We hypothesized ED opioid analgesic exposure is associated with subsequent at-risk opioid use.


Methods
Participants were enrolled in AURORA, a prospective cohort study of adult patients in 29 U.S., urban EDs receiving care for a traumatic event. Exclusion criteria were hospital admission, persons reporting any non-medical opioid use (e.g., opioids without prescription or taking more than prescribed for euphoria) in the 30 days before enrollment, and missing or incomplete data regarding opioid exposure or pain. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relationship between ED opioid exposure and at-risk opioid use, defined as any self-reported non-medical opioid use after initial ED encounter or prescription opioid use at 3-months.


Results
Of 1441 subjects completing 3-month follow-up, 872 participants were included for analysis. At-risk opioid use occurred within 3 months in 33/620 (5.3%, CI: 3.7,7.4) participants without ED opioid analgesic exposure; 4/16 (25.0%, CI: 8.3, 52.6) with ED opioid prescription only; 17/146 (11.6%, CI: 7.1, 18.3) with ED opioid administration only; 12/90 (13.3%, CI: 7.4, 22.5) with both. Controlling for clinical factors, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for at-risk opioid use after ED opioid exposure were: ED prescription only: 4.9 (95% CI 1.4, 17.4); ED administration for analgesia only: 2.0 (CI 1.0, 3.8); both: 2.8 (CI 1.2, 6.5).


Conclusions
ED opioids were associated with subsequent at-risk opioid use within three months in a geographically diverse cohort of adult trauma patients. This supports need for prospective studies focused on the long-term consequences of ED opioid analgesic exposure to estimate individual risk and guide therapeutic decision-making.

Limited work to date, however, has investigated potential racial/ethnic variability in amygdala reactivity or connectivity that may in turn be related to outcomes such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants from the AURORA study (n = 283), a multisite longitudinal study of trauma outcomes, completed functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysiology within approximately two-weeks of trauma exposure. Seed-based amygdala connectivity and amygdala reactivity during passive viewing of fearful and neutral faces were assessed during fMRI. Physiological activity was assessed during Pavlovian threat conditioning. Participants also reported the severity of posttraumatic symptoms 3 and 6 months after trauma. Black individuals showed lower baseline skin conductance levels and startle compared to White individuals, but no differences were observed in physiological reactions to threat. Further, Hispanic and Black participants showed greater amygdala connectivity to regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and cerebellum compared to White participants. No differences were observed in amygdala reactivity to threat. Amygdala connectivity was associated with 3-month PTSD symptoms, but the associations differed by racial/ethnic group and were partly driven by group differences in structural inequities. The present findings suggest variability in tonic neurophysiological arousal in the early aftermath of trauma between racial/ethnic groups, driven by structural inequality, impacts neural processes that mediate susceptibility to later PTSD symptoms.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Neuroimaging research on trauma has primarily focused on threat-processing circuitry as core to trauma-related dysfunction. Conversely, limited attention has been given to visual circuitry which may be particularly relevant to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prior work suggests that the ventral visual stream is directly related to the cognitive and affective disturbances observed in PTSD and may be predictive of later symptom expression. The present study used multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data (n = 278) collected two weeks after trauma exposure from the AURORA study, a longitudinal, multisite investigation of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae. Indices of gray and white matter were combined using data fusion to identify a structural covariance network (SCN) of the ventral visual stream 2 weeks after trauma. Participant’s loadings on the SCN were positively associated with both intrusion symptoms and intensity of nightmares. Further, SCN loadings moderated connectivity between a previously observed amygdala-hippocampal functional covariance network and the inferior temporal gyrus. Follow-up MRI data at 6 months showed an inverse relationship between SCN loadings and negative alterations in cognition in mood. Further, individuals who showed decreased strength of the SCN between 2 weeks and 6 months had generally higher PTSD symptom severity over time. The present findings highlight a role for structural integrity of the ventral visual stream in the development of PTSD. The ventral visual stream may be particularly important for the consolidation or retrieval of trauma memories and may contribute to efficient reactivation of visual components of the trauma memory, thereby exacerbating PTSD symptoms. Potentially chronic engagement of the network may lead to reduced structural integrity which becomes a risk factor for lasting PTSD symptoms.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Although studies have established relationships between neuroticism and neurological functioning in various brain regions for healthy and depressed individuals, the specific neural correlates of neuroticism for individuals with PTSD are yet unknown. This relationship is particularly relevant for women, given that their increased risk for PTSD is partially accounted for by their higher baseline levels of neuroticism. The current study examined previously established neural correlates of neuroticism in 61 women (48 women with interpersonal violence [IPV]/PTSD and 13 healthy controls). A specific region of interest map, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), was examined while participants completed an emotional conflict task. Results showed that the PTSD group had significantly higher neuroticism scores than the healthy control group ( t = 6.90, p &lt; .001). Higher neuroticism scores were associated with increased neural activity in the right dmPFC when participants were instructed to directly attend to faces with negative emotional valences. Significant trends between higher neuroticism scores and greater right amygdala and right ACC activation also emerged for this condition. Finally, neuroticism was found to be associated with right amygdala and right parahippocampal activity when participants were instructed to ignore faces with negative emotional valences. The results of this study lend further evidence to the proposed diathesis-stress model of neuroticism and PTSD. Moreover, findings suggest a significant association between neuroticism and neural activity in brain regions associated with fear and emotion regulation for women with IPV and subsequent PTSD. ",,,,

Contemporary literature has firmly established heightened negative affect (NA) as a risk and maintenance factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the relationship between NA and PTSD symptoms is not well understood within IPT survivors, the majority of whom are female, as much of this research has focused on combat veterans. In addition, the connection between positive affect (PA) and PTSD symptoms has yet to be examined. With increased emphasis on “negative alterations in cognitions and mood . . .” as an independent symptom cluster of PTSD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5), understanding the relationship between self-reported affectivity and the classic PTSD symptom clusters may be increasingly useful in differentiating symptom presentations of trauma-related psychopathology. The current study directly compared self-reported trait NA and PA with total severity and frequency cluster scores from the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) in 54 female survivors of IPT who met criteria for PTSD. Results identify NA (but not PA) as a consistent predictor of total PTSD symptoms and, specifically, re-experiencing symptoms. ",,,,

An analysis of these limitations may provide insight into improvements to the CBT approach to PTSD, beginning with an examination of negative affect as an essential component to the conceptualization of PTSD and a barrier to the implementation of CBT for PTSD. As such, the literature regarding the impact of negative affect on aspects of cognition (i.e., attention, processing, memory, and emotion regulation) necessary for the successful application of CBT was systematically reviewed. Several literature databases were explored (e.g., PsychINFO and PubMed), resulting in 25 articles that met criteria for inclusion. Results of the review indicated that high negative affect generally disrupts cognitive processes, resulting in a narrowed focus on stimuli of a negative valence, increased rumination of negative autobiographical memories, inflexible preservation of initial information, difficulty considering counterfactuals, reliance on emotional reasoning, and misinterpretation of neutral or ambiguous events as negative, among others. With the aim to improve treatment efficacy of CBT for PTSD, suggestions to incorporate negative affect into research and clinical contexts are discussed.",,,,

Med.,Cambridge University Press (CUP),6,53,2553-2562,2023-04-01,"['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Applied Psychology']","AbstractBackgroundRacial and ethnic groups in the USA differ in the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent research however has not observed consistent racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic stress in the early aftermath of trauma, suggesting that such differences in chronic PTSD rates may be related to differences in recovery over time.MethodsAs part of the multisite, longitudinal AURORA study, we investigated racial/ethnic differences in PTSD and related outcomes within 3 months after trauma. Participants (n = 930) were recruited from emergency departments across the USA and provided periodic (2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months after trauma) self-report assessments of PTSD, depression, dissociation, anxiety, and resilience. Linear models were completed to investigate racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic dysfunction with subsequent follow-up models assessing potential effects of prior life stressors.ResultsRacial/ethnic groups did not differ in symptoms over time; however, Black participants showed reduced posttraumatic depression and anxiety symptoms overall compared to Hispanic participants and White participants. Racial/ethnic differences were not attenuated after accounting for differences in sociodemographic factors. However, racial/ethnic differences in depression and anxiety were no longer significant after accounting for greater prior trauma exposure and childhood emotional abuse in White participants.ConclusionsThe present findings suggest prior differences in previous trauma exposure partially mediate the observed racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic depression and anxiety symptoms following a recent trauma. Our findings further demonstrate that racial/ethnic groups show similar rates of symptom recovery over time. Future work utilizing longer time-scale data is needed to elucidate potential racial/ethnic differences in long-term symptom trajectories.",,,,

A significant subset of this population will still develop persistent pain and posttraumatic psychological sequelae may play an important role in pain persistence.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a multisite longitudinal cohort study of adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae among patients seeking ED treatment in the aftermath of a traumatic life experience. We report on a sub-group of patients (n = 666) presenting after an MVC, the most common type of trauma and we examine associations of socio-demographic and MVC characteristics, and persistent pain 8 weeks after MVC. We also examine the degree to which these associations are related to peritraumatic psychological symptoms and 2-week acute stress reactions using an applied approach.<h4>Results</h4>Eight-week prevalence of persistent moderate or severe pain was high (67.4%) and positively associated with patient sex (female), older age, low socioeconomic status (education and income) and pain severity in the ED. Peritraumatic stress symptoms (distress and dissociation) appear to exert some influence on both acute pain and the transition from acute to persistent pain.<h4>Discussion and conclusions</h4>The early aftermath of an MVC may be an important time period for intervening to prevent and reduce persistent pain. Substantial variation in mediating pathways across predictors also suggests potential diverse and complex underlying biological and psychological pathogenic processes are at work in the early weeks following trauma.<h4>Significance</h4>The first several days after trauma may dictate recovery trajectories. Persistent pain, pain lasting beyond the expected time of recovery, is associated with pain early in the recovery period, but also mediated through other pathways. Future work is needed to understand the complex neurobiological processes in involved in the development of persistent and acute post-traumatic pain.",,33458880.0,"['Humans', 'Pain', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Accidents, Traffic', 'Demography', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Aged', 'Female']",

Peritraumatic distress was associated with 2-week but not 8-week depression. Most of these associations held when controlling for peritraumatic symptoms and, to a lesser degree, depressive symptoms at 2-weeks post-trauma.ConclusionsThese observations, coupled with substantial variation in the relative strength of the mediating pathways across predictors, raises the possibility of diverse and potentially complex underlying biological and psychological processes that remain to be elucidated in more in-depth analyses of the rich and evolving AURORA database to find new targets for intervention and new tools for risk-based stratification following trauma exposure.",,,,

Neuroimaging studies have largely focused on gray matter abnormalities in PTSD, with less information known about the integrity of white matter tracts. Prior studies of brain white matter in PTSD have produced mixed results, likely due to differences in neuroimaging sequences and clinical variables. This study addressed this gap by examining the microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum, the largest white matter fiber bundle in the brain, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Sixty adult females diagnosed with PTSD with a history of interpersonal violence were compared with 18 trauma-exposed controls. All participants underwent DTI using 1.5 T. MANOVA revealed significantly higher fractional anisotropy (FA; p = .012) in the genu of the corpus callosum (GCC) compared with the trauma-exposed controls. These results suggest the GCC to relate to PTSD symptomatology. Further studies of this mechanism may provide insight into improving treatment and prevention efforts. ",,,,

In the current study, we performed a linguistic analysis of impact statements (i.e., descriptions of how the trauma has affected the survivors' views of themselves, others, and the world) collected at the start of therapy from women with PTSD that was due to interpersonal trauma, with the goal of determining whether PTSD symptom clusters were associated with altered self-referential thought.

However, the hippocampus is heterogeneous, with subregions that may be uniquely affected in individuals with PTSD and depression.MethodsWe used random effects regressions and a harmonized neuroimaging protocol based on FreeSurfer (v6.0) to identify sub-structural hippocampal markers of current PTSD (C-PTSD), depression, and the interaction of these conditions across 31 cohorts worldwide (N=3,115;Mage=38.9±13.9 years). Secondary analyses tested these associations by sex and after modeling the simultaneous effects of remitted PTSD, childhood trauma, mild traumatic brain injury, and alcohol use disorder.ResultsA significant negative main effect of depression (n=800, vs. no depression, n=1456) was observed in the hippocampal tail (ß=−0.13) and CA1 (ß=−0.09) after adjusting for covariates and multiple testing (adjusted p’s (q)=0.028). A main effect of C-PTSD (n=1042 vs. control, n=1359) was not significant, but an interaction between C-PTSD and depression was significant in the CA1 (ß=−0.24, q=0.044). Pairwise comparisons revealed significantly smaller CA1 volumes in individuals with C-PTSD+Depression than controls (ß=−0.12, q=0.012), C-PTSD-only (ß=−0.17, q=0.001), and Depression-only (ß=−0.18, q=0.023). Follow-up analyses revealed sex effects in the hippocampal tail of depressed females, and an interaction effect of C-PTSD and depression in the fimbria of males.ConclusionsCollectively our results suggest that depression is a stronger predictor of hippocampal volumetry than PTSD, particularly in the CA1, and provide compelling evidence of more pronounced hippocampal phenotypes in comorbid PTSD and depression compared to either condition alone.",cc-by-nd,,,

While both dimensions demonstrate significant positive relationships with symptoms of PTSD, the relationship between the two within the context of the disorder has yet to be explored. Consistent with prior research in the social anxiety literature, the present study seeks to examine a model of mediation by which rumination accounts for the significant relationship between NA and PTSD symptoms. Participants included 65 female interpersonal trauma survivors diagnosed with PTSD using structured, clinician-administered interviews. Both NA and rumination were observed as significant predictors of PTSD symptoms, and the variables were significantly associated with each other. However, NA was no longer a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms when rumination was entered into the mediation model, suggesting full mediation of the relationship by rumination. Results from the current study suggest a complex relationship between NA and rumination in interpersonal trauma survivors with PTSD, such that a ruminative cognitive coping style may either mitigate or exacerbate PTSD symptoms in the presence of sustained negative emotion. The current findings provide support for a cognitive model of PTSD, within which PTSD symptoms are influenced via negative, ruminative cognitions. Primary implications of these results include (a) the consideration of assessment of rumination in interpersonal trauma survivors with PTSD in clinical settings; (b) the selection of treatment that may address a ruminative cognitive style in this population, given the mediation between subjective distress and PTSD symptoms by rumination; and (c) the necessity for the validation of this mediation model within other traumatized populations.

With data from the 2008 American National Election Studies survey, we specify the interactive influence of religious traditions on attitudes toward torture by religious commitment and belief orthodoxy. Only at low orthodoxy, and low to average commitment, are Catholics, mainline, and black Protestants more likely to support torture than the unaffiliated; the effect for evangelical Protestants is null. Greater commitment moves most traditions and the unaffiliated toward increased opposition to torture. Stronger orthodoxy, however, leads to support for torture only for the unaffiliated.

Party leaders, committee chairs and ranking members, and influential senators typically dominate national news attention. In this paper, I argue that scholars also need to consider the median voter in the House and the filibuster pivot in the Senate to gain a clearer understanding of national media coverage of Congress and its members. The results suggest that members do not receive more coverage simply from being the median voter or the filibuster pivot. Instead, the median voter in the House receives more attention when the majorities in the House are slim and thus the median voter is potentially more important. In the Senate, the filibuster pivot garners more attention from the national media, again conditioned on party margins, than other senators.",cc-by-nc-sa-4.0,,,

HFA is impairing and distressing and has been shown to disproportionately affect individuals with noncardiac chest pain (NCCP), chest pain that persists in the absence of an identifiable source. The Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire (CAQ) is a measure designed to assess HFA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties and factor structure of the CAQ in a sample of 229 adults diagnosed with NCCP. Results demonstrated that the CAQ is a useful measure of HFA in patients with NCCP and that a four-factor model including fear of cardiac sensations, avoidance of activities that elicit cardiac sensations, heart-focused attention, and reassurance seeking was the best fit for the data. Additionally, associations between CAQ subscales and two measures of health-related behaviors—pain-related interference and health care utilization—provided evidence of concurrent validity.

Results indicated that denial of impact was elevated in this patient group compared with reference groups, and denial was negatively associated with depression and anxiety at ps &lt; .01. Results indicated that depression, anxiety, and denial predicted unique variance in medical nonadherence, and gender moderated the relationships between these psychological factors and nonadherence. For depression, men and women showed similar relationships between depression and nonadherence at high levels of depression; however, at low levels of depression (i.e., a more normal mood state), men were less adherent compared with women. For anxiety, men and women did not differ in adherence at low levels of anxiety; however, men experiencing high anxiety were less adherent compared with women experiencing high anxiety. Implications of this study are discussed including the role of gender and denial and the impact of denial functioning to reduce negative affect. Depression was the only significant predictor of physical functioning. Results of this study suggest that psychological interventions aimed at depression and anxiety may function differently across gender to improve patient medical adherence and improve physical functioning in ACHD.

QOL was assessed using a linear analog scale (LAS) (0 to 100) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) (5 to 35). Patient characteristics included sex, age, marital status, educational level, employment status, CHD complexity, and patient-reported New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. Country-specific characteristics included general happiness and 6 cultural dimensions. Linear mixed models were applied.<h4>Results</h4>Median QOL was 80 on the LAS and 27 on the SWLS. Older age, lack of employment, no marriage history, and worse NYHA functional class were associated with lower QOL (p < 0.001). Patients from Australia had the highest QOL (LAS: 82) and patients from Japan the lowest (LAS: 72). Happiness scores and cultural dimensions were not associated with variation in QOL after adjustment for patient characteristics and explained only an additional 0.1% of the variance above and beyond patient characteristics (p = 0.56).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This large-scale, international study found that overall QOL in adults with CHD was generally good. Variation in QOL was related to patient characteristics but not country-specific characteristics. Hence, patients at risk for poorer QOL can be identified using uniform criteria. General principles for designing interventions to improve QOL can be developed.",publisher-specific-oa,27173035.0,"['Heart defects', 'International cooperation', 'Happiness', 'Multilevel Analysis', 'Cross-cultural Comparison', 'Humans', 'Heart Defects, Congenital', 'Linear Models', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Internationality', 'Quality of Life', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Male', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",

Less is known about the efficacy of these therapies for individuals who do not respond fully to short-term CBT.<h4>Method</h4>The current trial is a second-step stratified randomized design comparing two treatment conditions-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; paroxetine or citalopram; n = 34) and continued CBT (n = 24)-in a sample of individuals classified as treatment nonresponders to an initial course of CBT for panic disorder. Participants were randomized to 3 months of treatment and then followed for an additional 9 months. Only treatment responders after 3 months were maintained on the treatment until 12-month follow-up. Data analysis focused on panic disorder symptoms and achievement of response status across the first 3 months of treatment. Final follow-up data are presented descriptively.<h4>Results</h4>Participants in the SSRI condition showed significantly lower panic disorder symptoms as compared to continued CBT at 3 months. Results were similar when excluding individuals with comorbid major depression or analyzing the entire intent-to-treat sample. Group differences disappeared during 9-month naturalistic follow-up, although there was significant attrition and use of nonstudy therapies in both arms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These data suggest greater improvement in panic disorder symptoms when switching to SSRI after failure to fully respond to an initial course of CBT.

Better understanding of PROs and their differences across cultural and geographic barriers can best be accomplished via international studies using uniform research methods. The APPROACH-IS consortium (Assessment of Patterns of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Adults with Congenital Heart disease - International Study) was created for this purpose and investigates PROs in adults with CHD worldwide. This paper outlines the project rationale, design, and methods.<h4>Methods/design</h4>APPROACH-IS is a cross-sectional study. The goal is to recruit 3500-4000 adults with CHD from 15 countries in five major regions of the world (Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America). Self-report questionnaires are administered to capture information on PRO domains: (i) perceived health status (12-item Short-form Health Survey & EuroQOL-5D); (ii) psychological functioning (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale); (iii) health behaviors (Health-Behavior Scale-Congenital Heart Disease); and (iv) quality of life (Linear Analog Scale & Satisfaction With Life Scale). Additionally, potential explanatory variables are assessed: (i) socio-demographic variables; (ii) medical history (chart review); (iii) sense of coherence (Orientation to Life Questionnaire); and (iv) illness perceptions (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire). Descriptive analyses and multilevel models will examine differences in PROs and investigate potential explanatory variables.<h4>Discussion</h4>APPROACH-IS represents a global effort to increase research understanding and capacity in the field of CHD, and will have major implications for patient care. Results will generate valuable information for developing interventions to optimize patients' health and well-being.<h4>Registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02150603.",,25464481.0,"['Adult', 'Methods', 'Heart defects', 'International cooperation', 'congenital', 'Patient-reported Outcomes', 'Humans', 'Heart Defects, Congenital', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Research Design', 'Internationality', 'Female', 'Male', 'Self Report']",

QOL was assessed using a linear analog scale (LAS) (0 to 100) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) (5 to 35). Patient characteristics included sex, age, marital status, educational level, employment status, CHD complexity, and patient-reported New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. Country-specific characteristics included general happiness and 6 cultural dimensions. Linear mixed models were applied.<h4>Results</h4>Median QOL was 80 on the LAS and 27 on the SWLS. Older age, lack of employment, no marriage history, and worse NYHA functional class were associated with lower QOL (p < 0.001). Patients from Australia had the highest QOL (LAS: 82) and patients from Japan the lowest (LAS: 72). Happiness scores and cultural dimensions were not associated with variation in QOL after adjustment for patient characteristics and explained only an additional 0.1% of the variance above and beyond patient characteristics (p = 0.56).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This large-scale, international study found that overall QOL in adults with CHD was generally good. Variation in QOL was related to patient characteristics but not country-specific characteristics. Hence, patients at risk for poorer QOL can be identified using uniform criteria. General principles for designing interventions to improve QOL can be developed.",publisher-specific-oa,27173035.0,"['Heart defects', 'International cooperation', 'Happiness', 'Multilevel Analysis', 'Cross-cultural Comparison', 'Humans', 'Heart Defects, Congenital', 'Linear Models', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Internationality', 'Quality of Life', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Male', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",

Data were collected via online surveys from a community sample of men and women of diverse backgrounds. The main study hypotheses were supported, indicating a unique relation between anxiety and binge eating, and between stress and binge eating, independent of the impact of depression. Gender differences are discussed. The results of this study suggest a need for a more detailed examination of negative affect in binge eating. Furthermore, the role of anxiety may be important for future research. ",,,,

This study aimed to describe health behaviours in adults with congenital heart disease in 15 countries and to identify patient characteristics associated with optimal health behaviours in the international sample. Design This was a cross-sectional observational study. Methods Adults with congenital heart disease ( n = 4028, median age = 32 years, interquartile range 25–42 years) completed self-report measures as part of the Assessment of Patterns of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Adults with Congenital Heart disease - International Study (APPROACH-IS). Participants reported on seven health behaviours using the Health Behaviors Scale-Congenital Heart Disease. Demographic and medical characteristics were assessed via medical chart review and self-report. Multivariate path analyses with inverse sampling weights were used to investigate study aims. Results Health behaviour rates for the full sample were 10% binge drinking, 12% cigarette smoking, 6% recreational drug use, 72% annual dental visit, 69% twice daily tooth brushing, 27% daily dental flossing and 43% sport participation. Pairwise comparisons indicated that rates differed between countries. Rates of substance use behaviours were higher in younger, male participants. Optimal dental health behaviours were more common among older, female participants with higher educational attainment while sports participation was more frequent among participants who were younger, male, married, employed/students, with higher educational attainment, less complex anatomical defects and better functional status. Conclusions Health behaviour rates vary by country. Predictors of health behaviours may reflect larger geographic trends. Our findings have implications for the development and implementation of programmes for the assessment and promotion of optimal health behaviours in adults with congenital heart disease. ",,,,

            Introduction:
            Physical activity (PA) has well-known benefits for mental health, which is closely related to clinical outcomes in patients with heart disease; however, little is known about the relationship between PA and anxiety. In this study, we examined their association in a large international cohort of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients.
          
          
            Hypothesis:
            We hypothesize that different PA types would have differential impact on anxiety symptoms.
          
          
            Methods:
            We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of data derived from the
            Assessment of Patterns of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease - International Study
            . This study enrolled 4,028 ACHD patients from 24 centers in 15 countries. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Participants reported whether they were regular active commuters (either walk or cycle to work/school) and/or regular sport participants (either recreational or competitive). To assess the relationship between PA and anxiety, we constructed ordinal logistic mixed models, treating country as a random effect. We built an optimally-adjusted model via stepwise selection, which considered all variables having significant relations with anxiety in bivariate analyses and missing at a rate of &lt; 5%.
          
          
            Results:
            Of 3,893 patients (mean age of 35 ± 13) who completed the HADS, 53% were female; 27% reported elevated anxiety symptoms (i.e., HADS ≥ 8). No significant relationship was found between active commute and anxiety symptoms in bivariate analysis while sport participation was associated with a 40% lower risk of elevated anxiety. The benefit of sport participation on anxiety remained, even after accounting for relevant demographic and clinical variables (adjusted OR=0.769; 95% CI 0.654 - 0.906; p = 0.002) (Table 1).
          
          
            Conclusion:
            Sport participation is associated with fewer symptoms of anxiety. In conclusion, individualized sport-related exercise prescriptions may reduce anxiety symptoms in cardiac patients.

We found those who experienced childhood maltreatment had higher avoidant coping and eating disorder symptoms. We also found an additive effect for maltreatment, such that with more types of maltreatment experienced, avoidant coping and eating disorder symptoms were greater. We also found evidence of an indirect effect such that childhood maltreatment was related to eating disorder symptoms through avoidant coping. Future research is needed to better understand factors that may promote development of adaptive coping patterns and prevention of eating disorder symptoms. ",,,,

                  Background
                  Previous studies have found that sense of coherence (SOC) is positively related to quality of life (QoL) in persons with chronic conditions. In congenital heart disease (CHD), the evidence is scant.
               
               
                  Aims
                  We investigated (i) intercountry variation in SOC in a large international sample of adults with CHD; (ii) the relationship between demographic and clinical characteristics and SOC; (iii) the relationship between cultural dimensions of countries and SOC; and (iv) variation in relative importance of SOC in explaining QoL across the countries.
               
               
                  Methods
                  APPROACH-IS was a cross-sectional, observational study, with 4028 patients from 15 countries enrolled. SOC was measured using the 13-item SOC scale (range 13–91) and QoL was assessed by a linear analog scale (range 0–100).
               
               
                  Results
                  The mean SOC score was 65.5±13.2. Large intercountry variation was observed with the strongest SOC in Switzerland (68.8±11.1) and the lowest SOC in Japan (59.9±14.5). A lower SOC was associated with a younger age; lower educational level; with job seeking, being unemployed or disabled; unmarried, divorced or widowed; from a worse functional class; and simple CHD. Power distance index and individualism vs collectivism were cultural dimensions significantly related to SOC. SOC was positively associated with QoL in all participating countries and in the total sample, with an explained variance ranging from 5.8% in Argentina to 30.4% in Japan.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  In adults with CHD, SOC is positively associated with QoL. The implementation of SOC-enhancing interventions might improve QoL, but strategies would likely differ across countries given the substantial variation in explained variance.

                Objective
                To derive cluster analysis-based groupings for adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) when it comes to perceived health, psychological functioning, health behaviours and quality of life (QoL).

              
                Methods
                This study was part of a larger worldwide multicentre study called APPROACH-IS; a cross sectional study which recruited 4028 patients (2013–2015) from 15 participating countries. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using Ward's method in order to group patients with similar psychological characteristics, which were defined by taking into consideration the scores of the following tests: Sense Of Coherence, Health Behavior Scale (physical exercise score), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Illness Perception Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Visual Analogue Scale scores of the EQ-5D perceived health scale and a linear analogue scale (0–100) measuring QoL.
              
                Results
                3768 patients with complete data were divided into 3 clusters. The first and second clusters represented 89.6% of patients in the analysis who reported a good health perception, QoL, psychological functioning and the greatest amount of exercise. Patients in the third cluster reported substantially lower scores in all PROs. This cluster was characterised by a significantly higher proportion of females, a higher average age the lowest education level, more complex forms of congenital heart disease and more medical comorbidities.
              
                Conclusions
                This study suggests that certain demographic and clinical characteristics may be linked to less favourable health perception, quality of life, psychological functioning, and health behaviours in ACHD. This information may be used to improve psychosocial screening and the timely provision of psychosocial care.

Background
The relationship between healthcare system inputs (e.g., human resources and infrastructure) and mortality has been extensively studied. However, the association between healthcare system inputs and patient-reported outcomes remains unclear. Hence, we explored the predictive value of human resources and infrastructures of the countries’ healthcare system on patient-reported outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease.

Methods
This cross-sectional study included 3588 patients with congenital heart disease (median age = 31y; IQR = 16.0; 52% women; 26% simple, 49% moderate, and 25% complex defects) from 15 countries. The following patient-reported outcomes were measured: perceived physical and mental health, psychological distress, health behaviors, and quality of life. The assessed inputs of the healthcare system were: (i) human resources (i.e., density of physicians and nurses, both per 1000 people) and (ii) infrastructure (i.e., density of hospital beds per 10,000 people). Univariable, multivariable, and sensitivity analyses using general linear mixed models were conducted, adjusting for patient-specific variables and unmeasured country differences.

Results
Sensitivity analyses showed that higher density of physicians was significantly associated with better self-reported physical and mental health, less psychological distress, and better quality of life. A greater number of nurses was significantly associated with better self-reported physical health, less psychological distress, and less risky health behavior. No associations between a higher density of hospital beds and patient-reported outcomes were observed.

Conclusions
This explorative study suggests that density of human resources for health, measured on country level, are associated with patient-reported outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease. More research needs to be conducted before firm conclusions about the relationships observed can be drawn.

We found those who experienced childhood maltreatment had higher avoidant coping and eating disorder symptoms. We also found an additive effect for maltreatment, such that with more types of maltreatment experienced, avoidant coping and eating disorder symptoms were greater. We also found evidence of an indirect effect such that childhood maltreatment was related to eating disorder symptoms through avoidant coping. Future research is needed to better understand factors that may promote development of adaptive coping patterns and prevention of eating disorder symptoms. ",,,,

                  Background
                  Previous studies have found that sense of coherence (SOC) is positively related to quality of life (QoL) in persons with chronic conditions. In congenital heart disease (CHD), the evidence is scant.
               
               
                  Aims
                  We investigated (i) intercountry variation in SOC in a large international sample of adults with CHD; (ii) the relationship between demographic and clinical characteristics and SOC; (iii) the relationship between cultural dimensions of countries and SOC; and (iv) variation in relative importance of SOC in explaining QoL across the countries.
               
               
                  Methods
                  APPROACH-IS was a cross-sectional, observational study, with 4028 patients from 15 countries enrolled. SOC was measured using the 13-item SOC scale (range 13–91) and QoL was assessed by a linear analog scale (range 0–100).
               
               
                  Results
                  The mean SOC score was 65.5±13.2. Large intercountry variation was observed with the strongest SOC in Switzerland (68.8±11.1) and the lowest SOC in Japan (59.9±14.5). A lower SOC was associated with a younger age; lower educational level; with job seeking, being unemployed or disabled; unmarried, divorced or widowed; from a worse functional class; and simple CHD. Power distance index and individualism vs collectivism were cultural dimensions significantly related to SOC. SOC was positively associated with QoL in all participating countries and in the total sample, with an explained variance ranging from 5.8% in Argentina to 30.4% in Japan.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  In adults with CHD, SOC is positively associated with QoL. The implementation of SOC-enhancing interventions might improve QoL, but strategies would likely differ across countries given the substantial variation in explained variance.

Results indicated that denial of impact was elevated in this patient group compared with reference groups, and denial was negatively associated with depression and anxiety at ps &lt; .01. Results indicated that depression, anxiety, and denial predicted unique variance in medical nonadherence, and gender moderated the relationships between these psychological factors and nonadherence. For depression, men and women showed similar relationships between depression and nonadherence at high levels of depression; however, at low levels of depression (i.e., a more normal mood state), men were less adherent compared with women. For anxiety, men and women did not differ in adherence at low levels of anxiety; however, men experiencing high anxiety were less adherent compared with women experiencing high anxiety. Implications of this study are discussed including the role of gender and denial and the impact of denial functioning to reduce negative affect. Depression was the only significant predictor of physical functioning. Results of this study suggest that psychological interventions aimed at depression and anxiety may function differently across gender to improve patient medical adherence and improve physical functioning in ACHD.

            Introduction:
            Physical activity (PA) has well-known benefits for mental health, which is closely related to clinical outcomes in patients with heart disease; however, little is known about the relationship between PA and anxiety. In this study, we examined their association in a large international cohort of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients.
          
          
            Hypothesis:
            We hypothesize that different PA types would have differential impact on anxiety symptoms.
          
          
            Methods:
            We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of data derived from the
            Assessment of Patterns of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease - International Study
            . This study enrolled 4,028 ACHD patients from 24 centers in 15 countries. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Participants reported whether they were regular active commuters (either walk or cycle to work/school) and/or regular sport participants (either recreational or competitive). To assess the relationship between PA and anxiety, we constructed ordinal logistic mixed models, treating country as a random effect. We built an optimally-adjusted model via stepwise selection, which considered all variables having significant relations with anxiety in bivariate analyses and missing at a rate of &lt; 5%.

            Of 3,893 patients (mean age of 35 ± 13) who completed the HADS, 53% were female; 27% reported elevated anxiety symptoms (i.e., HADS ≥ 8). No significant relationship was found between active commute and anxiety symptoms in bivariate analysis while sport participation was associated with a 40% lower risk of elevated anxiety. The benefit of sport participation on anxiety remained, even after accounting for relevant demographic and clinical variables (adjusted OR=0.769; 95% CI 0.654 - 0.906; p = 0.002) (Table 1).
          
          
            Conclusion:
            Sport participation is associated with fewer symptoms of anxiety. In conclusion, individualized sport-related exercise prescriptions may reduce anxiety symptoms in cardiac patients.

                Objective
                To derive cluster analysis-based groupings for adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) when it comes to perceived health, psychological functioning, health behaviours and quality of life (QoL).

              
                Methods
                This study was part of a larger worldwide multicentre study called APPROACH-IS; a cross sectional study which recruited 4028 patients (2013–2015) from 15 participating countries. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using Ward's method in order to group patients with similar psychological characteristics, which were defined by taking into consideration the scores of the following tests: Sense Of Coherence, Health Behavior Scale (physical exercise score), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Illness Perception Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Visual Analogue Scale scores of the EQ-5D perceived health scale and a linear analogue scale (0–100) measuring QoL.
              
                Results
                3768 patients with complete data were divided into 3 clusters. The first and second clusters represented 89.6% of patients in the analysis who reported a good health perception, QoL, psychological functioning and the greatest amount of exercise. Patients in the third cluster reported substantially lower scores in all PROs. This cluster was characterised by a significantly higher proportion of females, a higher average age the lowest education level, more complex forms of congenital heart disease and more medical comorbidities.
              
                Conclusions
                This study suggests that certain demographic and clinical characteristics may be linked to less favourable health perception, quality of life, psychological functioning, and health behaviours in ACHD. This information may be used to improve psychosocial screening and the timely provision of psychosocial care.

This study aimed to describe health behaviours in adults with congenital heart disease in 15 countries and to identify patient characteristics associated with optimal health behaviours in the international sample. Design This was a cross-sectional observational study. Methods Adults with congenital heart disease ( n = 4028, median age = 32 years, interquartile range 25–42 years) completed self-report measures as part of the Assessment of Patterns of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Adults with Congenital Heart disease - International Study (APPROACH-IS). Participants reported on seven health behaviours using the Health Behaviors Scale-Congenital Heart Disease. Demographic and medical characteristics were assessed via medical chart review and self-report. Multivariate path analyses with inverse sampling weights were used to investigate study aims. Results Health behaviour rates for the full sample were 10% binge drinking, 12% cigarette smoking, 6% recreational drug use, 72% annual dental visit, 69% twice daily tooth brushing, 27% daily dental flossing and 43% sport participation. Pairwise comparisons indicated that rates differed between countries. Rates of substance use behaviours were higher in younger, male participants. Optimal dental health behaviours were more common among older, female participants with higher educational attainment while sports participation was more frequent among participants who were younger, male, married, employed/students, with higher educational attainment, less complex anatomical defects and better functional status. Conclusions Health behaviour rates vary by country. Predictors of health behaviours may reflect larger geographic trends. Our findings have implications for the development and implementation of programmes for the assessment and promotion of optimal health behaviours in adults with congenital heart disease. ",,,,

Better understanding of PROs and their differences across cultural and geographic barriers can best be accomplished via international studies using uniform research methods. The APPROACH-IS consortium (Assessment of Patterns of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Adults with Congenital Heart disease - International Study) was created for this purpose and investigates PROs in adults with CHD worldwide. This paper outlines the project rationale, design, and methods.<h4>Methods/design</h4>APPROACH-IS is a cross-sectional study. The goal is to recruit 3500-4000 adults with CHD from 15 countries in five major regions of the world (Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America). Self-report questionnaires are administered to capture information on PRO domains: (i) perceived health status (12-item Short-form Health Survey & EuroQOL-5D); (ii) psychological functioning (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale); (iii) health behaviors (Health-Behavior Scale-Congenital Heart Disease); and (iv) quality of life (Linear Analog Scale & Satisfaction With Life Scale). Additionally, potential explanatory variables are assessed: (i) socio-demographic variables; (ii) medical history (chart review); (iii) sense of coherence (Orientation to Life Questionnaire); and (iv) illness perceptions (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire). Descriptive analyses and multilevel models will examine differences in PROs and investigate potential explanatory variables.<h4>Discussion</h4>APPROACH-IS represents a global effort to increase research understanding and capacity in the field of CHD, and will have major implications for patient care. Results will generate valuable information for developing interventions to optimize patients' health and well-being.<h4>Registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02150603.",,25464481.0,"['Adult', 'Methods', 'Heart defects', 'International cooperation', 'congenital', 'Patient-reported Outcomes', 'Humans', 'Heart Defects, Congenital', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Research Design', 'Internationality', 'Female', 'Male', 'Self Report']",

Background
The relationship between healthcare system inputs (e.g., human resources and infrastructure) and mortality has been extensively studied. However, the association between healthcare system inputs and patient-reported outcomes remains unclear. Hence, we explored the predictive value of human resources and infrastructures of the countries’ healthcare system on patient-reported outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease.

Methods
This cross-sectional study included 3588 patients with congenital heart disease (median age = 31y; IQR = 16.0; 52% women; 26% simple, 49% moderate, and 25% complex defects) from 15 countries. The following patient-reported outcomes were measured: perceived physical and mental health, psychological distress, health behaviors, and quality of life. The assessed inputs of the healthcare system were: (i) human resources (i.e., density of physicians and nurses, both per 1000 people) and (ii) infrastructure (i.e., density of hospital beds per 10,000 people). Univariable, multivariable, and sensitivity analyses using general linear mixed models were conducted, adjusting for patient-specific variables and unmeasured country differences.

Results
Sensitivity analyses showed that higher density of physicians was significantly associated with better self-reported physical and mental health, less psychological distress, and better quality of life. A greater number of nurses was significantly associated with better self-reported physical health, less psychological distress, and less risky health behavior. No associations between a higher density of hospital beds and patient-reported outcomes were observed.

Conclusions
This explorative study suggests that density of human resources for health, measured on country level, are associated with patient-reported outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease. More research needs to be conducted before firm conclusions about the relationships observed can be drawn.

Face-to-face treatment has been the first choice for clinicians, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital psychological interventions have substantially increased. Few studies have examined young people's interest in internet treatment or the attitudes they and their parents have toward it.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to investigate adolescents' and parents' attitudes toward and experiences of internet-based cognitive behavioral anxiety treatment in primary care and its presumptive effects.<h4>Methods</h4>The study used mixed methods, analyzing qualitative data thematically and quantitative data with nonparametric analysis. Participants were 14 adolescents and 14 parents recruited in adolescent primary health care clinics. The adolescents and their parents filled out mental health questionnaires before and after treatment, and were interviewed during ongoing treatment.<h4>Results</h4>The quantitative data indicated that the internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program used in this study was successful in reducing symptoms (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>=8.333; P=.02) and that adolescents' motivation is essential to the treatment outcome (r=0.58; P=.03). The qualitative results show that youths highly value their independence and freedom to organize treatment work on their own terms. The parents expressed uncertainty about their role and how to support their child in treatment. It was important for parents to respect the youths' need for autonomy while also engaging with them in the treatment work.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Internet treatment in primary care is accepted by both youths and their parents, who need clarification about the difference between their role and the therapist's role. Patient motivation should be considered before treatment, and therapists need to continue to develop the virtual alliance. Finally, primary care should be clearer in informing adolescents and their parents about the possibility of internet treatment.",cc-by,34723830.0,"['Internet', 'Parents', 'Youths', 'Anxiety', 'Adolescents', 'Primary Care', 'Cbt', 'Experiences', 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy', 'Mixed Methods', 'Digital Health']",PMC8593797

Less is known about the efficacy of these therapies for individuals who do not respond fully to short-term CBT.<h4>Method</h4>The current trial is a second-step stratified randomized design comparing two treatment conditions-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; paroxetine or citalopram; n = 34) and continued CBT (n = 24)-in a sample of individuals classified as treatment nonresponders to an initial course of CBT for panic disorder. Participants were randomized to 3 months of treatment and then followed for an additional 9 months. Only treatment responders after 3 months were maintained on the treatment until 12-month follow-up. Data analysis focused on panic disorder symptoms and achievement of response status across the first 3 months of treatment. Final follow-up data are presented descriptively.<h4>Results</h4>Participants in the SSRI condition showed significantly lower panic disorder symptoms as compared to continued CBT at 3 months. Results were similar when excluding individuals with comorbid major depression or analyzing the entire intent-to-treat sample. Group differences disappeared during 9-month naturalistic follow-up, although there was significant attrition and use of nonstudy therapies in both arms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These data suggest greater improvement in panic disorder symptoms when switching to SSRI after failure to fully respond to an initial course of CBT. Future studies should further investigate relapse following treatment discontinuation for nonresponders who became responders.

QOL was assessed using a linear analog scale (LAS) (0 to 100) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) (5 to 35). Patient characteristics included sex, age, marital status, educational level, employment status, CHD complexity, and patient-reported New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. Country-specific characteristics included general happiness and 6 cultural dimensions. Linear mixed models were applied.<h4>Results</h4>Median QOL was 80 on the LAS and 27 on the SWLS. Older age, lack of employment, no marriage history, and worse NYHA functional class were associated with lower QOL (p < 0.001). Patients from Australia had the highest QOL (LAS: 82) and patients from Japan the lowest (LAS: 72). Happiness scores and cultural dimensions were not associated with variation in QOL after adjustment for patient characteristics and explained only an additional 0.1% of the variance above and beyond patient characteristics (p = 0.56).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This large-scale, international study found that overall QOL in adults with CHD was generally good. Variation in QOL was related to patient characteristics but not country-specific characteristics. Hence, patients at risk for poorer QOL can be identified using uniform criteria.

This market-oriented policy has forced social service nonprofits to adopt the market practice and culture. As a result, nonprofits are becoming business-like entities striving for a share of the social service market. This study examines organizational factors that give competitive advantage to nonprofits in the social service market under the voucher system. Specifically, the study uses data collected from 35 nonprofit organizations in Busan, South Korea, to examine whether voucher revenues, an indicator of market share, is associated with organizational characteristics, including organizational culture and structure. The results may suggest strategies that help nonprofits to gain a greater share in the social service market. ",,,,

The difference‐in‐difference approach is applied to compare individuals with and without disabilities regarding their food security status in adolescence and young adulthood. Instrumental Variable analyses are conducted using state SNAP policy rules as exogenous instruments to estimate the effects of SNAP participation on food security status for youth and young adults with disabilities.ResultsResults indicate that transition into adulthood results in greater food security for individuals without disabilities but an increased risk of low food security for individuals with disabilities. The increased risk for young adults with disabilities may well put them at very low food security, the most severe category on the food security scale. SNAP participation appears to have greater impacts for youth than for young adults.ConclusionsSince food security likely has a profound impact on the long‐term development, economic independence, and self‐sufficiency, we discuss a few policy strategies that may help individuals with disabilities in their transition to adulthood.","publisher-specific, author manuscript",,,

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to consider the utility of school-based research for studying gangs and gang members. Police–researcher collaborations have led to considerable advancements in the understanding of gang involvement and its consequences. But the current social environment should encourage scholars to take stock of alternative methodologies to examine gang-related questions.


Design/methodology/approach
In this paper, the authors reflect on the advantages of school-based research designs for studying gang affiliated youth, primarily contrasting the data derived from school-based designs to official data from police.


Findings
xSpecifically, the authors discuss the key advantages of school-based survey research, identify concerns that can arise from such designs and offer recommendations as to how to mitigate such concerns.


Originality/value
This paper provides a discussion on the utility of gang-related research and guidance on addressing potential limitations.

This paper aims to identify factors that predict consumers’ attitudes and intentions toward usage of Instagram, a relatively new social media tool. In addition, it examines the role of an important dimension of culture – individualism vs collectivism –to determine cultural influences on the adoption of social media in the USA (i.e. an individualistic culture) and Kuwait (i.e. a collectivist culture).Design/methodology/approachData were collected from a convenience sample of undergraduate business and MBA students from Kuwait and the USA. To validate the measures for the constructs depicted in the conceptual model, the authors conducted an exploratory factor analysis using all items. They then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to further evaluate the adequacy and validity of the measurement model. They also tested the hypotheses using structural equation modeling (SEM).FindingsOut of the nine hypotheses that were tested for significance, the SEM results indicated that seven hypotheses were significant. The results indicated a non-significant result between perceived critical mass is not a predictor of perceived usefulness and social influence to attitude.Research limitations/implicationsThe current study has some limitations that need to be recognized and can be used as guidelines for future research. First, college students represent only a portion of online users and may impact the external validity of our study. Hence, a more diverse sample with a broader range of ages, incomes, education levels, cultures and national origins would be advisable. Second, this study featured a dynamically continuous innovation (Instagram) rather than a discontinuous innovation. Third, other factors can be carried out to see other variables other than those described in this study to predict consumer’s attitude and intention to use the social media.Practical implicationsCultural characteristics such as individualism/collectivism would seem to be potentially useful when segmenting countries. The results of the current study indicate that the modified model is applicable to a cross-national group of social media users. This study demonstrates the impact of cultural characteristics on various technology adoption. Hence, managers must be aware that countries can be grouped according to the type of cultural effect within each. Each social media category, clusters can be formed consisting of countries that are expected to have similar usage patterns based on technological capability and social norms. By understanding the factors that influence each cluster of countries, firms can design customized social media programs.Social implicationsThis research provides valuable information to better understand the consumers’ attitudes and intentions toward the emerging social media landscape. Indeed, the popularity of social media has greatly changed the way in which people communicate in today’s world. In particular, Instagram has gradually become a major communication media for both social and business purposes. This research shed light into the factors that influence intentions to adopt social media across different cultures. It empirically examines the role of culture – individualism vs collectivism – by using two samples (i.e. Kuwait and the USA) to determine cultural influences on the adoption of social media in different cultures.Originality/valueUsing data drawn from Kuwait and US samples, this current study draws upon the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975) and the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989). The results of the analysis indicate that the modified model is applicable to a cross-national group of social media users. Moreover, this study demonstrates the impact of cultural characteristics on various technology adoption constructs in the model.",,,,

In the present study we developed a QOL questionnaire specific to MG (MG-QOL) that assesses both physical and psychological aspects of function. The MG-QOL questionnaire was administered as a secondary measure of efficacy in a recently completed prospective trial of mycophenolate mofetil involving 80 MG patients. Comparisons indicated that the MG-QOL performed better than a nondisease-specific measure of QOL, the SF-36, in demonstrating disease change as assessed by the primary measure, the Quantitative MG score (QMG).

Previous studies demonstrated that SH burden accounts for a degree of the cognitive burden among VaD patients, although it remains unclear if individual factors such as cognitive reserve influence cognitive status in VaD. To address this issue, we examined 36 individuals diagnosed with probable VaD (age = 77.56; education = 12). All individuals underwent MMSE evaluations and MRI brain scans. We predicted that individuals with higher educational attainment would exhibit less cognitive difficulty despite similar levels of SH volume, compared to individuals with less educational attainment. A regression analysis revealed that greater SH volume was associated with lower scores on the MMSE. Additionally, education moderated the relationship between SH volume and MMSE score, demonstrating that individuals with higher education had higher scores on the MMSE despite similar degrees of SH burden. These results suggest that educational attainment buffers the deleterious effects of SH burden on cognitive status among VaD patients. (JINS, 2011,17, 531–536)",,,,

Depression was measured by the Child Depression Inventory for children &lt;15 years, or the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scales for youth ≥15 years); behavioral problems were measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-caregiver report). Among 195 AYA-PHIV (median age 16.9 years), 25.6% reported a lifetime experience of enacted stigma, while 10.8% experienced social problems due to HIV infection. The frequency of depressive symptoms was nearly two-fold higher among AYA-PHIV with compared to those without HIV-related enacted stigma (34.7% vs. 16.0%, p = 0.005). Caregiver-reported behavioral problems were detected in 14.6% of all AYA-PHIV, with no differences between those with and without HIV-related enacted stigma. Low household income and caregiver mental health problems were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms; HIV-related enacted stigma was also associated with increased risk, warranting targeted services to support AYA-PHIV.

            Background:
            HIV-infected children with long-term nonprogressive (LTNP) disease eventually convert to a progressive disease type, yet the extent to which these children experience the cognitive and emotional symptoms observed in typical progressive HIV (Progressors) is unknown.
          
          
            Methods:
            Eighty-eight LTNPs, 53 Progressors, and 323 healthy controls completed annual assessments of cognitive and emotional health as part of a prospective study. The 2 HIV-infected groups and the healthy controls were matched on age and sex distribution at enrollment. Plasma HIV RNA, T-cell counts/percentages, activated monocytes, perivascular monocytes, and markers of macrophage activation (sCD163 and sCD14) were compared by progression subtype. Cognitive and emotional outcomes were compared using cross-sectional linear regression analysis and longitudinal sensitivity models.
          
          
            Results:
            LTNPs exhibited the same cognitive phenotype and emotional dysregulation as Progressors, with worse outcomes in both groups compared with controls. In addition, cognitive and emotional symptoms were evident before children reached the minimum age for LTNP designation (8 years). Baseline plasma HIV RNA, sCD163, activated monocytes, and perivascular monocytes were lower in LTNPs versus Progressors, with no difference in T-cell counts/percentages or sCD14 levels. Most LTNPs converted to a progressive disease subtype during the study, with similar cognitive and emotion profiles between these subgroups.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Pediatric LTNPs experience cognitive and emotional difficulties that mirror symptoms of progressive disease. The abnormalities are present at young ages and persist independent of plasma T-cell counts. The findings highlight the neurodevelopmental risk of pediatric HIV, even in those with early innate disease control.

A cross-sectional study was conducted on participants investigated for HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment in South Africa. HIV-1 proviral DNA was quantified using a PCR assay targeting a highly conserved HIV-1 LTR-gag region. Fifty-four (36.7%) participants were cognitively impaired and 93 (63.3%) were not impaired. Forty-three (79.6%) of the cognitively impaired participants were female and 11 (20.4%) were male. There was no significant age difference between cognitively impaired and unimpaired participants (p = 0.42). HIV-1 DNA in cognitively impaired PLWH was significantly higher than in cognitively normal individuals (p = .016). Considering impaired participants, lymphocyte HIV-1 DNA was significantly higher in males than females (p = 0.02). There was a modest positive correlation between lymphocyte HIV-1 DNA and global deficit scores (GDS) r = 0.176; p = 0.03). The two measures of viral load, lymphocyte HIV-1 DNA copies/million and plasma RNA copies/ml, were positively correlated (r = 0.39; p &lt; .001). After adjusting for other covariates, age, sex, treatment status, and the interactions between impairment and treatment, the multivariate regression showed association between proviral load and neurocognitive impairment; omega effect size was 0.04, p value = 0.010. The burden of HIV-1 peripheral blood lymphocyte proviral DNA corresponds to neurocognitive impairment among individuals infected with clade C disease. Therefore, therapeutic strategies to reduce the HIV-1 proviral DNA reservoir in lymphocytes may improve neurocognitive outcomes in PLWH.",cc-by-4.0,,,

            Objective:
            This study examined relationships between anticholinergic medication burden and brain integrity in people living with HIV (PLWH) and people without HIV (HIV−).
          
          
            Methods:
            Neuropsychological performance z-scores (learning, retention, executive function, motor/psychomotor speed, language domains, and global cognition), and neuroimaging measures (brain volumetrics and white matter fractional anisotropy) were analyzed in PLWH (n = 209) and HIV− (n = 95) grouped according to the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale (0 = no burden, 1–3 = low burden, &gt;3 = high burden). Neuropsychological performance and neuroimaging outcomes were compared between HIV− and PLWH with high anticholinergic burden. Within a cohort of PLWH (n = 90), longitudinal change in ACB score over ∼2 years was correlated to the rate of change per month of study interval in neuropsychological performance and neuroimaging measures.
          
          
            Results:
            A higher number of anticholinergic medications and ACB was observed in PLWH compared with HIV− (P &lt; 0.05). A higher ACB was associated with worse motor/psychomotor performance, smaller occipital lobe, putamen, subcortical gray matter and total gray matter volumes in HIV−; and poorer executive function, retention and global cognition, smaller brain volumes (frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, hippocampus, amygdala, cortex, subcortical gray matter and total gray matter), and reduced fractional anisotropy (posterior corpus callosum, perforant pathway) in PLWH. PLWH with high anticholinergic burden performed worse on tests of learning and executive function compared with HIV− with high anticholinergic burden. Longitudinally, PLWH who reduced their ACB over time had better neuropsychological performance and neuroimaging measures.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            Anticholinergic medications were associated with worse neuropsychological performance and reduced structural brain integrity, and these effects were more widespread in PLWH. Use of anticholinergic medications should be carefully monitored in older adults with deprescription considered whenever possible.

            Objective:
            Despite suppression of HIV-1 replication in the periphery by antiretroviral therapy (ART), up to 10% of treated individuals have quantifiable HIV-1 in the CSF, termed CSF escape. CSF escape may be asymptomatic but has also been linked to progressive neurological disease, and may indicate persistence of HIV in the central nervous system (CNS). CSF escape has not yet been assessed after initiation of ART during acute HIV-1 infection (AHI).
          
          
            Design:
            Prospective cohort study.
          
          
            Setting:
            Major voluntary counseling and testing site in Bangkok, Thailand.
          
          
            Participants:
            Participants identified and initiated on ART during AHI who received an optional study lumbar puncture at pre-ART baseline or after 24 or 96 weeks of ART.
          
          
            Main outcome measures:
            Paired levels of CSF and plasma HIV-1 RNA, with CSF greater than plasma HIV-1 RNA defined as CSF escape.
          
          
            Results:
            Two hundred and four participants had paired blood and CSF sampling in at least one visit at baseline, week 24, or week 96. Twenty-nine participants had CSF sampling at all three visits. CSF escape was detected in 1/90 at week 24 (CSF HIV-1 RNA 2.50 log10 copies/ml, plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml), and 0/55 at week 96.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            Although levels of CSF HIV-1 RNA in untreated AHI are high, initiating treatment during AHI results in a very low rate of CSF escape in the first 2 years of treatment. Early treatment may improve control of HIV-1 within the CNS compared with treatment during chronic infection, which may have implications for long-term neurological outcomes and CNS HIV-1 persistence.

We investigated the frequency and associations of suboptimal CD4 recovery after ART started during acute HIV infection (AHI).<h4>Methods</h4>Participants who started ART in Fiebig I to V AHI with ≥48 weeks of continuous documented HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL were stratified by CD4 count at latest study visit to suboptimal immune recovery (SIR; CD4 < 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> ), intermediate immune recovery (IIR; 350 ≤ CD4 < 500) and complete immune recovery (CIR; CD4 ≥ 500). Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed at pre-ART baseline and latest study visit. Additional inflammatory and neurobehavioral endpoints were examined at baseline and 96 weeks.<h4>Results</h4>Of 304 participants (96% male, median 26 years old) evaluated after median 144 (range 60 to 420) weeks of ART initiated at median 19 days (range 1 to 62) post-exposure, 3.6% (n = 11) had SIR and 14.5% (n = 44) had IIR. Pre-ART CD4 count in SIR compared to CIR participants was 265 versus 411 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (p = 0.002). Individuals with SIR or IIR had a slower CD4 rate of recovery compared to those with CIR. Timing of ART initiation by Fiebig stage did not affect CD4 count during treatment. Following ART, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell count (p = 0.001) and CD4/CD8 ratio (p = 0.047) were lower in SIR compared to CIR participants. Compared to the CIR group at week 96, the combined SIR and IIR groups had higher sCD14 (p = 0.008) and lower IL-6 (p = 0.04) in plasma, without differences in neuropsychological or psychiatric indices.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite immediate and sustained treatment in AHI, suboptimal CD4 recovery occurs uncommonly and is associated with low pre-ART CD4 count as well as persistent low CD8 count and CD4/CD8 ratio during treatment.",cc-by,32949118.0,"['Asia', 'immunology', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men', 'Arv', 'Lmic', 'Hiv Care Continuum', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', 'HIV-1', 'HIV Infections', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'Cohort Studies', 'Prospective Studies', 'Adult', 'Middle Aged', 'Male', 'Young Adult']",PMC7507109

            People with HIV continue to exhibit cognitive symptoms after suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). It remains unclear if initiating ART during acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) uniformly improves cognitive outcomes.
          
          
            Methods:
            Sixty-seven individuals (96% men, median age 28 years) initiated ART immediately after AHI diagnosis and maintained viral suppression for 6 years. They underwent a four-test neuropsychological battery that measured fine motor speed and dexterity, psychomotor speed, and executive functioning at baseline (pre-ART AHI), weeks 12, 24 and 96, and annually thereafter through week 288. Performances were standardized to calculate an overall (NPZ-4) score and frequencies of impaired cognitive performance (≤-1 SD on at least two tests, or ≤-2 SD on at least one test). Group-based trajectory analysis (GBTA) was applied to identify distinct neuropsychological trajectories modelled from baseline to week 288. Posthoc analyses examined HIV-1 and demographic factors that differed between trajectory subgroups.
          
          
            Results:
            NPZ-4 scores improved from baseline to week 96 (P &lt; 0.001) and from weeks 96 to 288 (P &lt; 0.001), with frequencies of impaired performance of 30, 6 and 2% at the respective time-points. The amplitude of NPZ-4 improvement throughout the period was more than 0.5 SD and beyond practice effects. GBTA identified three NPZ-4 trajectory subgroups that all showed improvement over-time. The subgroup with lowest baseline performance exhibited worse depressive symptoms at baseline (P = 0.04) and the largest improvement among the three. HIV-1 indices did not differ between the subgroups.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            Cognitive performance improved in a sustained and stable manner after initiating ART during AHI. Largest improvements were seen in participants with worst baseline cognitive performance.

	    Background
	    Cognitive and behavioral impairment are common in children living with perinatally acquired HIV (pHIV) and children exposed to HIV in utero but uninfected (HEU).
	  
	  
	    Methods
	    We sought to determine the prevalence of adverse behavioral symptomatology using a Thai-translated and validated version of the SNAP-IV questionnaire and assess cognitive function utilizing the Children's Color Trails Test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales, in our cohort of Thai adolescents (10–20 years old) with well-controlled pHIV compared to HEU and HIV-unexposed, uninfected youth. We then evaluated the interaction between HIV status, behavioral impairment, and executive function outcomes independent of demographic variables.
	  
	  
	    Results
	    After controlling for demographic factors of age and household income, adolescents with pHIV had higher inattentive symptomatology and poorer neuropsychological test scores compared to uninfected controls. Significant interactions were found between inattention and executive function across multiple neurocognitive tests.
	  
	  
	    Conclusions
	    Behavioral impairment and poor executive functioning are present in adolescents with well-controlled pHIV compared to HIV-uninfected matched peers. The SNAP-IV questionnaire may be a useful tool to identify those with attentional impairment who may benefit from further cognitive testing in resource-limited settings.

Seventy HIV+ individuals underwent neuropsychological testing, structural neuroimaging, laboratory tests, and completed a PA questionnaire, recalling participation in walking, running, and jogging activities over the last year. A PA engagement score of weekly metabolic equivalent (MET) hr of activity was calculated using a compendium of PAs. HIV+ individuals were classified as physically active (any energy expended above resting expenditure,n=22) or sedentary (n=48). Comparisons of neuropsychological performance, grouped by executive and motor domains, and brain volumes were completed between groups. Physically active and sedentary HIV+ individuals had similar demographic and laboratory values, but the active group had higher education (14.0vs. 12.6 years,p=.034). Physically active HIV+ individuals performed better on executive (p=.040, unadjusted;p=.043, adjusted) but not motor function (p=.17). In addition, among the physically active group the amount of physical activity (METs) positively correlated with executive (Pearson’s r=0.45,p=0.035) but not motor (r=0.21;p=.35) performance. In adjusted analyses the physically active HIV+ individuals had larger putamen volumes (p=.019). A positive relationship exists between PA and brain integrity in HIV+ individuals. Results from the present study emphasize the importance to conduct longitudinal interventional investigation to determine if PA improves brain integrity in HIV+ individuals.

                  Background
                  Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH) are characterized by altered brain structure and function. As they attain normal lifespans, it has become crucial to understand potential interactions between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and aging. However, it remains unclear how brain aging varies with viral load (VL).
               
               
                  Methods
                  In this study, we compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers among PWH with undetectable VL (UVL; ≤50 genomic copies/mL; n = 230), PWH with detectable VL (DVL; &amp;gt;50 copies/mL; n = 93), and HIV-uninfected (HIV–) controls (n = 206). To quantify gray matter cerebral blood flow (CBF), we utilized arterial spin labeling. To measure structural aging, we used a publicly available deep learning algorithm to estimate brain age from T1-weighted MRI. Cognitive performance was measured using a neuropsychological battery covering 5 domains.
               
               
                  Results
                  Associations between age and CBF varied with VL. Older PWH with DVL had reduced CBF vs PWH with UVL (P = .02). Structurally predicted brain aging was accelerated in PWH vs HIV– controls regardless of VL (P &amp;lt; .001). Overall, PWH had impaired learning, executive function, psychomotor speed, and language compared to HIV– controls. Structural brain aging was associated with reduced psychomotor speed (P &amp;lt; .001).
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Brain aging in HIV is multifaceted. CBF depends on age and current VL and is improved by medication adherence. By contrast, structural aging is an indicator of cognitive function and reflects serostatus rather than current VL.

                Background
                Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that affects many regions of the world. Infection, in utero, causes microcephaly and later developmental and neurologic impairments. The impact of ZIKV infection on neurocognition in adults has not been well described. The objective of the study was to assess the neurocognitive impact of ZIKV infection in adult rhesus macaques.
              
                Methods
                Neurocognitive assessments were performed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) via a touch screen and modified Brinkman Board before and after subcutaneous ZIKV inoculation. Immune activation markers were measured in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) by multiplex assay and flow cytometry.
              
                Results
                All animals (N = 8) had detectable ZIKV RNA in plasma at day 1 post-inoculation (PI) that peaked at day 2 PI (median 5.9, IQR 5.6–6.2 log10 genome equivalents/mL). In all eight animals, ZIKV RNA became undetectable in plasma by day 14 PI, but persisted in lymphoid tissues. ZIKV RNA was not detected in the CSF supernatant at days 4, 8, 14 and 28 PI but was detected in the brain of 2 animals at days 8 and 28 PI. Elevations in markers of immune activation in the blood and CSF were accompanied by a reduction in accuracy and reaction speed on the CANTAB in the majority of animals.
              
                Conclusions
                The co-occurrence of systemic and CSF immune perturbations and neurocognitive impairment establishes this model as useful for studying the impact of neuroinflammation on neurobehavior in rhesus macaques, as it pertains to ZIKV infection and potentially other pathogens.

            Background:
            Medication adherence is a critical issue in achieving viral suppression targets, particularly in resource-limited countries. As HIV-related cognitive impairment (CI) impacts adherence, we examined frequency and predictors of CI in the African Cohort Study.
          
          
            Setting:
            Cross-sectional examination of enrollment data from President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief supported clinic sites.
          
          
            Methods:
            In a 30-minute cognitive assessment, CI was defined as -1SD on 2 tests or -2SD on one, as compared with 429 controls. We performed univariable and multivariable logistic and linear models examining clinical and demographic factors associated with CI and global neuropsychological performance (NP-6).
          
          
            Results:
            Two thousand four hundred seventy-two HIV+ participants from Kenya (n = 1503), Tanzania (n = 469), and Uganda (n = 500). The mean (SD) age was 39.7 (10.7) years, and 1452 (59%) were women. The majority reported completing or partially completing primary school (n = 1584, 64%). Mean (SD) current and nadir CD4 count were 463 (249) and 204 (221) cells/mm3, respectively; 1689 (68%) were on combination antiretroviral therapy. Nine hundred thirty-nine (38%) HIV+ versus 113 (26%) HIV− individuals showed CI: (P &lt; 0.001). We found significant effects of literacy [odds ratio (OR): 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.4; P &lt; 0.001] and World Health Organization stage 4 (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.q; P = 0.046) on CI. Tanzanians (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 2.4 to 4.3; P &lt; 0.001) and Kenyans (OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.6 to 2.6; P &lt; 0.001) had higher risk of CI compared with Ugandans. Results were relatively unchanged in predictive models of NP-6, with the only difference being an additional significant effect of current CD4 cell count (coeff: 0.0; 95% CI: 0.0 to 0.0; P = 0.005).
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Literacy, country, World Health Organization stage, and current CD4 cell count were associated with increased risk of cognitive dysfunction. Our findings help optimize care practices in Africa, illustrating the importance of strategies for early and effective viral-immunological control.

            Objective:
            Despite combined antiretroviral therapy, neuroinflammation may persist in persons living with HIV (PLWH) and contribute to cognitive impairment in this population. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging targeting 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has been used to localize neuroinflammation. We aimed to use TSPO-PET imaging to evaluate neuroinflammation in PLWH.
          
          
            Design:
            Twenty-four virologically suppressed PLWH on combined antiretroviral therapy and 13 HIV-negative (HIV−) controls completed TSPO-PET imaging using the radiotracer [11C]PBR28. Because of tracer complexity and differing procedures used in previous studies, we employed an expansive methodological approach, using binding potential (BP) and standard uptake value ratio and multiple different reference regions to estimate [11C]PBR28 binding.
          
          
            Methods:
            [11C]PBR28 binding was measured in 30 cortical and subcortical regions and compared between PLWH and HIV− controls. Pearson correlation evaluated the association between [11C]PBR28 binding and cognition and clinical measures of HIV.
          
          
            Results:
            Analyses conducted using multiple reference regions and measures of tracer uptake revealed no significant differences between [11C]PBR28 binding in PLWH compared with HIV− controls. In addition, [11C]PBR28 binding in PLWH was not significantly associated with clinical measures of HIV or plasma biomarkers of inflammation. [11C]PBR28 binding was not significantly elevated in cognitively impaired PLWH compared with unimpaired PLWH, but there were inverse relationships between cognitive performance (executive and global function) and [11C]PBR28 binding in PLWH.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Our results suggest that neuroinflammation may play a role in cognitive deficits, but overall neuroinflammatory levels as measured by TSPO-PET imaging in PLWH are not significantly different from those seen in HIV− controls.

Bariatric surgery has recently been shown to result in improved memory at 12‐weeks postoperatively. However, the long‐term effects of bariatric surgery on cognitive function remain unclear.Design and MethodsEighty‐six individuals (63 bariatric surgery patients, 23 obese controls) were recruited from a prospective study examining the neurocognitive effects of bariatric surgery. All participants completed self‐report measurements and a computerized cognitive test battery prior to surgery and at 12‐week and 24‐month follow‐up; obese controls completed measures at equivalent time points.ResultsBariatric surgery patients exhibited high rates of pre‐operative cognitive impairments in attention, executive function, memory, and language. Relative to obese controls, repeated measures ANOVA showed improvements in memory from baseline to 12‐weeks and 24‐months postoperatively (P &lt; 0.05). Regression analyses controlling for baseline factors revealed that a lower BMI at 24‐months demonstrated a trend toward significance for improved memory (β = −.30, P = 0.075).ConclusionThese findings suggest that cognitive benefits of bariatric surgery may extend to 24‐months postoperatively. Larger prospective studies with extended follow‐up periods are needed to elucidate whether bariatric surgery decreases risk for cognitive decline and possibly the development of dementia.",,,,

Individuals with a history of ELS reported stressors such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, poverty, and/or physical illnesses in childhood. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that current symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress scores were positively associated with a history of ELS. In addition, anxiety and depression scores were negatively associated with being married when high (defined as three or more experiences) ELS was entered as the second predictor variable. This implies that for those individuals experiencing a greater number of stressing events in childhood, maintaining a stable romantic relationship may be beneficial for their mental health. However, the relationship between marital status, depression, and anxiety needs further exploration in order to either confirm or deny this suggestion. Finally, being married was positively associated with stress scores. ",,,,

            Objective:
            To develop a predictive model of neurocognitive trajectories in children with perinatal HIV (pHIV).
          
          
            Design:
            Machine learning analysis of baseline and longitudinal predictors derived from clinical measures utilized in pediatric HIV.
          
          
            Methods:
            Two hundred and eighty-five children (ages 2–14 years at baseline; Mage = 6.4 years) with pHIV in Southeast Asia underwent neurocognitive assessment at study enrollment and twice annually thereafter for an average of 5.4 years. Neurocognitive slopes were modeled to establish two subgroups [above (n = 145) and below average (n = 140) trajectories). Gradient-boosted multivariate regressions (GBM) with five-fold cross validation were conducted to examine baseline (pre-ART) and longitudinal predictive features derived from demographic, HIV disease, immune, mental health, and physical health indices (i.e. complete blood count [CBC]).
          
          
            Results:
            The baseline GBM established a classifier of neurocognitive group designation with an average AUC of 79% built from HIV disease severity and immune markers. GBM analysis of longitudinal predictors with and without interactions improved the average AUC to 87 and 90%, respectively. Mental health problems and hematocrit levels also emerged as salient features in the longitudinal models, with novel interactions between mental health problems and both CD4+ cell count and hematocrit levels. Average AUCs derived from each GBM model were higher than results obtained using logistic regression.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            Our findings support the feasibility of machine learning to identify children with pHIV at risk for suboptimal neurocognitive development. Results also suggest that interactions between HIV disease and mental health problems are early antecedents to neurocognitive difficulties in later childhood among youth with pHIV.

            Virologically suppressed PLWH (n = 297) on combination antiretroviral therapy and 1509 HIV-uninfected healthy controls were evaluated. PLWH were further classified as cognitively normal (CN) or cognitively impaired (CI) based on neuropsychological testing.
          
          
            Methods:
            Feature selection identified resting-state networks (RSNs) that predicted HIV status and cognitive status within specific age bins (younger than 35 years, 35–55 years, and older than 55 years). Deep learning models generated voxelwise maps of RSNs to identify regional differences.
          
          
            Results:
            Salience (SAL) and parietal memory networks (PMNs) differentiated individuals by HIV status. When comparing controls with PLWH CN, the PMN and SAL had the strongest predictive strength across all ages. When comparing controls with PLWH CI, the SAL, PMN, and frontal parietal network (FPN) were the best predictors. When comparing PLWH CN with PLWH CI, the SAL, FPN, basal ganglia, and ventral attention were the strongest predictors. Only minor variability in predictive strength was observed with aging. Anatomically, differences in RSN topology occurred primarily in the dorsal and rostral lateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate, and caudate.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            Machine learning identified RSNs that classified individuals by HIV status and cognitive status. The PMN and SAL were sensitive for discriminating HIV status, with involvement of FPN occurring with cognitive impairment. Minor differences in RSN predictive strength were observed by age. These results suggest that specific RSNs are affected by HIV, aging, and HIV-associated cognitive impairment.

To facilitate discussion on emerging and future directions in HAND research, a meeting was held in Durban, South Africa in March 2015 as part of the Society of Neuroscientists of Africa (SONA) conference. The objective of the meeting was to assess the impact of HIV subtype diversity on HAND and immunological dysfunction. The meeting brought together international leaders in the area of neurological complications of HIV-1 infection with special focus on the African population. Research presentations indicated that HAND was highly prevalent and that inflammatory cytokines and immune-activation played important roles in progression of neurocognitive impairment. Furthermore, children on antiretroviral therapy were also at risk for developing neurocognitive impairment. With respect to the effect of HIV-1 subtype diversity, analyses of HIV-1 clade C infection among South Africans revealed that clade C infection induced cognitive impairment that was independent of the substitution in HIV-1 Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat; C31S). At the cellular level, a Zambian study showed that clade C infection resulted in reduced brain cell death compared with clade B infection suggesting clade specific variations in mediating brain cell injury. Furthermore, ex vivo Tat protein from clade CRF02_AG, prevalent in West/ Central Africa, exhibited reduced disruption of brain endothelium compared with clade B Tat protein.

Introduction
Dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is currently the first-line treatment for people living with HIV. Neuropsychiatric adverse events (NP-AEs) have been reported with DTG but neuropsychiatric symptoms have not been systemically quantified using structured scales. This study examined mood and cognitive parameters before and after a planned transition from non-DTG to DTG-based ART within a longitudinal study of acute HIV infection (AHI).

Methods
RV254 AHI cohort participants on ≥ 24 weeks of ART initiated at AHI underwent sequential assessments before and after the switch including: (1) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a 9-item survey (scores 0–27) that evaluates somatic and affective/cognitive symptoms of depression; (2) a 2-Questions screening that has been validated locally for depression; (3) Distress Thermometer (scores 0–10); and 4) administration of a 4-test neurocognitive battery sensitive to HIV.

Results
254 individuals (95% male, median age 30) switched to a DTG-based regimen after a median 144 weeks of ART. Serial assessments were completed at a median of 19 weeks before and 37 weeks after DTG. There was a modest but statistically significant increase in PHQ-9 scores after DTG (pre-switch: 5 [IQR 1–7] vs. Post-switch: 5 [IQR 2–8], p = 0.009). The percentage of participants with at least moderate depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) increased from 10 to 16% (p = 0.006), but the frequency of moderate-severe depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 15) remained unchanged (3%). No volunteer reported NP-AEs within the study period. Somatic symptoms of depression increased more than cognitive/affective symptoms. Plasma viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50; p = 0.005) and PHQ-9 ≥ 10 (p &lt; 0.001) before switch were linked to lower PHQ-9 scores after DTG in multivariable analysis. Performance on all neuropsychological tests, except grooved pegboard test, improved modestly after DTG (all p &lt; 0.05).

Conclusion
After a median duration of 37 weeks of DTG use, there was a modest increase in the higher quartile of PHQ-9. This increase was associated with a rise in moderate depression symptoms but not the more severe forms of depression on PHQ-9. No clinically relevant NP-AEs were reported. Pre-existing depression was not associated with subsequent worsening of symptoms after DTG. Cognitive test performance improved post-DTG but could be due to practice effect.

            Background:
            Frailty is an important clinical concern for the aging population of people living with HIV (PLWH). The objective of this study was to identify the combination of risk features that distinguish frail from nonfrail individuals.
          
          
            Setting:
            Machine learning analysis of highly dimensional risk features was performed on a clinical cohort of PLWH.
          
          
            Methods:
            Participants included 105 older (average age = 55.6) PLWH, with at least a 3-month history of combination antiretroviral therapy (median CD4 = 546). Predictors included demographics, HIV clinical markers, comorbid health conditions, cognition, and neuroimaging (ie, volumetrics, resting-state functional connectivity, and cerebral blood flow). Gradient-boosted multivariate regressions were implemented to establish linear and interactive classification models. Model performance was determined by sensitivity/specificity (F1 score) with 5-fold cross validation.
          
          
            Results:
            The linear gradient-boosted multivariate regression classifier included lower current CD4 count, lower psychomotor performance, and multiple neuroimaging indices (volumes, network connectivity, and blood flow) in visual and motor brain systems (F1 score = 71%; precision = 84%; and sensitivity = 66%). The interactive model identified novel synergies between neuroimaging features, female sex, symptoms of depression, and current CD4 count.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Data-driven algorithms built from highly dimensional clinical and brain imaging features implicate disruption to the visuomotor system in older PLWH designated as frail individuals. Interactions between lower CD4 count, female sex, depressive symptoms, and neuroimaging features suggest potentiation of risk mechanisms. Longitudinal data-driven studies are needed to guide clinical strategies capable of preventing the development of frailty as PLWH reach advanced age.

            Background:
            Children with vertically acquired HIV exhibit persistent cognitive impairments, yet the corresponding neuroimaging signature of vertical infection remains unclear.
          
          
            Methods:
            Fifty healthy control children and 51 vertically infected children were included in the study. The HIV-infected group consisted of survivors who had not received antiretroviral therapy at birth. The HIV-infected group averaged 11.4 (2.5) years of age, with a median CD4 count of 683 cells/mm3. Most (71%) of the HIV-infected children were on antiretroviral therapy for a median of 34 months (range: 33–42) with HIV RNA &lt;40 copies/mL in 89% of the sample. The HIV-uninfected group averaged 10.6 (2.6) years of age. Magnetic resonance imaging was acquired to determine volumes of the caudate, putamen, thalamus, pallidum, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, total white matter, total gray matter and cortical gray matter. Correlational analyses examined the degree of shared variance between brain volumes and both cognitive performances and laboratory markers of disease activity (T cells and plasma viral load).
          
          
            Results:
            HIV-infected children exhibited larger volumes of the caudate, nucleus accumbens, total gray matter and cortical gray matter when compared with the controls. Volumetric differences were predominately evident in children under 12 years of age. HIV-infected children performed worse than controls on most neuropsychologic tests, though neither cognitive performances nor laboratory markers corresponded to brain volumes in the HIV-infected children.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Outcomes of the present study suggest abnormal brain maturation among HIV-infected pediatric survivors. Longitudinal studies of brain integrity and related resilience factors are needed to determine the impact of neuroimaging abnormalities on psychosocial function in pediatric HIV.

            Background:
            This study examined whether recommended viral load (VL) classifications by the Department of Health and Human Services map onto changes in brain integrity observed in people living with HIV (PLWH).
          
          
            Methods:
            Three hundred forty-nine PLWH on combination antiretroviral therapy meeting criteria for virologic suppression (VS) (VL ≤ 20 copies/mL; n = 206), “low-level viremia” (20–200 copies/mL; n = 63), or virologic failure (VF) (&gt;200 copies/mL; n = 80) and 195 demographically similar HIV-negative controls were compared for cognition and brain volumes from 10 regions of interest that are sensitive to HIV. Changes in cognition and brain volumes were examined in a subset of PLWH (n = 132) who completed a follow-up evaluation (mean interval = 28 months) and had no change in treatment regimen.
          
          
            Results:
            Significant differences in cognition and brain volumes were observed between the HIV-negative control and VS groups compared with those in the VF groups, with few differences observed between the 3 PLWH subgroups. Longitudinally, PLWH who continued to have VF exhibited a greater decline in cognition and brain volumes compared with PLWH who remained with VS. Observed longitudinal changes in cognition correlated with brain volume changes.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            PLWH with continued VF (consecutive VL measurements of &gt;200 copies/mL) represent a cause for clinical concern and may benefit from change in treatment in addition to consideration of other potential etiologies of VF to reduce loss of brain integrity.

It is critical to evaluate the CNS safety of studies using analytic treatment interruption (ATI) to assess HIV remission.MethodsThirty participants who started ART during acute HIV infection underwent CNS assessments across 4 ATI remission trials. ART resumption occurred with plasma viral load &amp;gt;1000 copies/mL. CNS measures included paired pre- vs post-ATI measures of mood, cognitive performance, and neurologic examination, with elective cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).ResultsMedian participant age was 30 years old and 29/30 were male. Participants’ median time on ART before ATI was 3 years, and ATI lasted a median of 35 days. Post-ATI, there were no differences in median mood scores or neurologic findings and cognitive performance improved modestly. During ATI, a low level of CSF HIV-1 RNA was detectable in 6 of 20 participants with plasma viremia, with no group changes in CSF immune activation markers or brain DTI measures. Mild worsening was identified in post-ATI basal ganglia total choline MRS, suggesting an alteration in neuronal membranes.ConclusionNo adverse CNS effects were observed with brief, closely monitored ATI in participants with acutely treated HIV, except an MRS alteration in basal ganglia choline. Further studies are needed to assess CNS ATI safety in HIV remission trials, particularly for studies using higher thresholds to restart ART and longer ATI durations.",,,,

            Introduction:
            Early systemic and central nervous system viral replication and inflammation may affect brain integrity in people with HIV, leading to chronic cognitive symptoms not fully reversed by antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study examined associations between cognitive performance and markers of CNS injury associated with acute HIV infection and ART.
          
          
            Methods:
            HIV-infected MSM and transgender women (average age: 27 years and education: 13 years) enrolled within 100 days from the estimated date of detectable infection (EDDI). A cognitive performance (NP) protocol was administered at enrollment (before ART initiation) and every 24 weeks until week 192. An overall index of cognitive performance (NPZ) was created using local normative data. Blood (n = 87) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 29) biomarkers of inflammation and neuronal injury were examined before ART initiation. Regression analyses assessed relationships between time since EDDI, pre-ART biomarkers, and NPZ.
          
          
            Results:
            Adjusting for multiple comparisons, shorter time since EDDI was associated with higher pre-ART VL and multiple biomarkers in plasma and CSF. NPZ scores were within the normative range at baseline (NPZ = 0.52) and at each follow-up visit, with a modest increase through week 192. Plasma or CSF biomarkers were not correlated with NP scores at baseline or after ART.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Biomarkers of CNS inflammation, immune activation, and neuronal injury peak early and then decline during acute HIV infection, confirming and extending results of other studies. Neither plasma nor CSF biomarkers during acute infection corresponded to NP scores before or after sustained ART in this cohort with few psychosocial risk factors for cognitive impairment.

            Objective
            Depression, substance use disorders, and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities are common in people with HIV (PWH), but the underlying mechanisms are not sufficiently understood. HIV-induced damage to the gastrointestinal tract potentiates residual immune dysregulation in PWH receiving effective antiretroviral therapy. However, few studies among PWH have examined the relevance of microbiome-gut-brain axis: bidirectional crosstalk between the gastrointestinal tract, immune system, and central nervous system.
          
          
            Methods
            A narrative review was conducted to integrate findings from 159 articles relevant to psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) and microbiome-gut-brain axis research in PWH.
          
          
            Results
            Early PNI studies demonstrated that neuroendocrine signaling via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system could partially account for the associations of psychological factors with clinical HIV progression. This review highlights the need for PNI studies examining the mechanistic relevance of the gut microbiota for residual immune dysregulation, tryptophan catabolism, and oxytocin release as key biological determinants of neuropsychiatric comorbidities in PWH (i.e., body-to-mind pathways). It also underscores the continued relevance of neuroendocrine signaling via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system, and oxytocin release in modifying microbiome-gut-brain axis functioning (i.e., mind-to-body pathways).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Advancing our understanding of PNI and microbiome-gut-brain axis pathways relevant to depression, substance use disorders, and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities in PWH can guide the development of novel biobehavioral interventions to optimize health outcomes. Recommendations are provided for biobehavioral and neurobehavioral research investigating bidirectional PNI and microbiome-gut-brain axis pathways among PWH in the modern antiretroviral therapy era.

Here, we examined how soon after infection HIV-associated epigenetic changes may occur in blood and whether early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) impacts epigenetic modifications. We profiled longitudinal genome-wide DNA methylation in monocytes and CD4+T lymphocytes from 22 participants in the RV254/SEARCH010 acute HIV infection (AHI) cohort that diagnoses infection within weeks after estimated exposure and immediately initiates ART. We identified monocytes harbored 22,697 differentially methylated CpGs associated with AHI compared to 294 in CD4+T lymphocytes. ART minimally restored less than 1% of these changes in monocytes and had no effect upon T cells. Monocyte DNA methylation patterns associated with viral load, CD4 count, CD4/CD8 ratio, and longitudinal clinical phenotypes.

            Background:
            Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has allowed for viral load (VL) suppression and increased life expectancy for persons with HIV (PWH). Altered brain integrity, measured by neuropsychological (NP) performance and neuroimaging, is still prevalent among virally suppressed PWH. Age-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease may also affect brain integrity. This study investigated the effects of cardiovascular risk, VL, and HIV serostatus on cerebral blood flow (CBF), brain volumetrics, and cognitive function in PWH and persons without HIV (PWoH).
          
          
            Methods:
            Ten-year cardiovascular risk, using the Framingham Heart Study criteria, was calculated in PWH (n = 164) on cART with undetectable (≤20 copies/mL; n = 134) or detectable (&gt;20 copies/mL; n = 30) VL and PWoH (n = 66). The effects of cardiovascular risk on brain integrity (CBF, volume, and cognition) were compared for PWH (undetectable and detectable VL) and PWoH.
          
          
            Results:
            PWH had smaller brain volumes and worse NP scores than PWoH. PWH with detectable and undetectable VL had similar brain integrity measures. Higher cardiovascular risk was associated with smaller volumes and lower CBF in multiple brain regions for PWH and PWoH. Significant interactions between HIV serostatus and cardiovascular risk on brain volumes were observed in frontal, orbitofrontal, and motor regions. Cardiovascular risk was not associated with cognition for PWH or PWoH.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Neuroimaging, but not cognitive measures, was associated with elevated cardiovascular risk. HIV serostatus was associated with diminished brain volumes and worse cognition while CBF remained unchanged, reflecting potential protective effects of cART. Neuroimaging measures of structure (volume) and function (CBF) may identify contributions of comorbidities, but future longitudinal studies are needed.

We argue that the inclusion of scholarship from the global South is essential to the goal of recognizing epistemological diversity. Further, different theories of knowledge need to coexist to transform diversity into cognitive justice.

Paternalism in the context of leadership reflects a hierarchical relationship and is based on the assumption of power inequality. The current body of research on PL is fragmented, with research emerging from an array of different cultural contexts. While cross-cultural research interest provides an inclusive cultural base for theoretical development, it has also led to a lack of conceptual clarity, insufficient delineation of research paradigms, and inconsistent results. In the extant PL literature, two broad conceptualizations can be identified. First, there is theoretical and empirical research disseminating from Turkey, which defines PL as a hierarchical relationship in which the leader guides employees in their professional and personal lives, in a manner resembling a parent, and in return expects loyalty and deference. This definition refers to PL as a construct comprised of benevolent and authoritative leadership, common in the Middle East. Second, there is a more authoritarian definition emerging from China which suggests a configural approach and refers to PL as a combination of authoritarian, benevolent, and moral leadership. Given these two established and diverse conceptualizations, the definition of PL depends, in part, on one’s cultural context and theoretical perspective.",cc-by-nc-nd,,,

Moreover, the inefficiency of state ownership in transforming R&amp;D input into innovation output decreases when industrial competition is high, as well as for start-up firms. Our findings integrate the efficiency logic (agency theory), which views state ownership as detrimental to innovation, and institutional logic, which notes that governments in emerging economies have critical influences on regulatory policies and control over scarce resources. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on state ownership and firm innovation in emerging economies. ",,,,
Export Relational Governance and  Control Mechanisms: Substitutable and Complementary Effects,2015.0,"[{'given': 'Dorothy Liu', 'family': 'Yang', 'name': 'Dorothy Liu Yang'}, {'given': 'Min', 'family': 'Ju', 'name': 'Min Ju'}, {'given': 'Gerald Yong', 'family': 'Gao', 'name': 'Gerald Yong Gao'}]",International Marketing Review,10.1108/imr-10-2014-0317,journal-article,['0265-1335'],,,Emerald,6,32,627-645,2015-11-09,"['Marketing', 'Business and International Management']","Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to examine the direct and interaction effects of relational governance and two control mechanisms, output control and process control in the context of international exchange relationships. Cross-border exchange relationships receive growing attention in the literature. Yet extant research has mainly examined single governance mechanisms. Among the few studies that investigate the interaction effects of relational governance and control mechanisms, some believe that the two mechanisms have conflicting effects, whereas others argue that they are complementary in nature.Design/methodology/approach– Based on a sample of 184 Chinese export ventures, the empirical paper adopts the hierarchical moderated multiple regression approach.Findings– The authors find that relational governance contributes positively to export performance, while output control leads negatively to export performance. The findings further suggest that output control complements relational governance to enhance export performance when combined. However, process control and relational governance substitute each other and reduce effectiveness when used simultaneously.Research limitations/implications– The study sheds new light on the ongoing debate about whether control mechanisms substitute or complement relational governance.Originality/value– The study is novel in addressing the issue of how relational governance interacts differently with two control mechanisms in the international exchange relationships.",,,,
Relational Governance and Control Mechanisms of      Export Ventures: An Examination across Relationship Length,2017.0,"[{'given': 'Min', 'family': 'Ju', 'name': 'Min Ju'}, {'given': 'Gerald Yong', 'family': 'Gao', 'name': 'Gerald Yong Gao'}]",Journal of International Marketing,10.1509/jim.16.0070,journal-article,"['1069-031X', '1547-7215']",Journal of International Marketing,Journal of International Marketing,SAGE Publications,2,25,72-87,2017-06-01,"['Marketing', 'Business and International Management']","Relational governance and control mechanisms are important means of managing interfirm relationships. Yet, the effectiveness of different governance mechanisms remains equivocal, especially in the international context. In this study, the authors investigate the value of relational and control governance across relationship length. Using a survey of 217 export ventures from China, they find that relational governance is not effective for short-term relationships but that it becomes effective in the long run. Output control improves export performance across short- and long-term relationships, whereas process control has its limits and weakens export performance for short-term relationships. In addition, the findings show that relational governance positively moderates the effects of output and process control on export performance for long-term relationships.",,,,

Previous studies have examined the relationships between supplier management–related variables and market performance with cross-sectional data; however, little guidance is available for newly internationalizing ventures aiming to build a global supply chain network from scratch. To shed light on this dynamic process, we examine Uniqlo's successful supply chain development in China, using longitudinal contextual data. Our findings show that Uniqlo went through discrete dynamic stages in its supply chain development efforts. First, Uniqlo, initially a small firm, developed relational governance with its suppliers by exercising dynamic economic power concentration over time. Second, it began to provide technical support to help its suppliers build competence with the aim of increasing their cooperation. Third, Uniqlo enforced compulsory nonexclusivity arrangements with suppliers to achieve supplier flexibility by not just having Uniqlo as primary customer. This provides relational flexibility through both relational governance and partner flexibility for the principal firm in the global supply chain development. ",,,,

While hookah use is known internationally to be a health and addiction risk, the focus is on university students and not on families.Aim: This study aims to compare the family functioning and family satisfaction among hookah users and non-users.Setting: This study was conducted in low or middle-high class socio-economic status areas of Cape Town, South Africa.Methods: A quantitative method was employed to test for significant differences with a sample of 1193 participants, in which each participant represented a family. An independent t-test was used to test for significant differences between hookah users and non-users.Results: One-third (34%) of the participants indicated that they smoked hookah pipe, with the general age of onset being 16.5 years. In trying to understand the family context, it was found that 28% of hookah users indicated that the hookah pipe was used as a means of socialising with others in the family, and 24% of parents indicated that they were more accepting of family members smoking the hookah pipe. Findings also suggest that families of hookah users have less cohesion, expressiveness and family satisfaction, and more conflict and permissiveness than families of non-users.Conclusion: This study provides and extends knowledge regarding the family in hookah pipe use. This information could assist in reducing hookah pipe use, and building healthier and more resilient communities by formulating prevention and intervention strategies to reduce hookah use.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Ferrocenium cations have been employed as catalysts in a number of organic transformations, and we investigated the stability of a number of ferrocenium salts in solution. The observed rate decomposition constants for [Fc]Cl, [Fc]PF6, [Fc]BF4, [Fc]CSA [Fc = ferrocenium, CSA = camphor-10-sulfonate (β)], [AcFc]SbF6, (AcFc = acetylated ferrocene), and [FcB(OH)2]SbF6 [FcB(OH)2 = ferrocenylboronic acid] were determined in CH2Cl2 solution by time-resolved UV-vis spectroscopy. The rate decomposition constants depended on the nature of the counterion, with [Fc]Cl being the most stable complex in solution. The decomposition rate constants dropped by roughly an order of magnitude in most cases when the experiments were performed in nitrogenated solvent, demonstrating that the decomposition is mainly an oxidative process. The cosolvent HFIP (1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropan-2-ol) slowed the decomposition of the ferrocenium cations as well. Many catalytic or stoichiometric reactions of ferrocenium cations are performed with alcohols; we determined that hexan-1-ol is decomposed over the course of 16 hours, but not oxidized in the presence of a ferrocenium cation. Finally, the different ferrocenium cations were employed in a test reaction to determine catalytic activity. The nucleophilic substitution of hydroxyl groups in a tertiary propargylic alcohol by an alcohol is catalyzed by all complexes, and, again, a counterion dependency of the catalytic activity was observed. Also, HFIP increases the catalytic activity of the ferrocenium cations. The research has importance in the development of ferrocenium-based catalyst systems, because changes in the counterion as well as the architecture of the ferrocenium cation have an influence on stability and catalytic activity.",,,,
Transition Metal Catalyzed Glycosylation Reactions - An Overview,2020.0,"[{'given': 'Eike B', 'family': 'Bauer', 'name': 'Eike B Bauer'}]",Organic & biomolecular chemistry,10.1039/d0ob01782e,journal-article,1477-0520,Org Biomol Chem,Org Biomol Chem,Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC),45,18,9160-9180,2020-11-01,"['Organic Chemistry', 'Physical and Theoretical Chemistry', 'Biochemistry']","Carbohydrates are a large class of natural products that play key roles in a number of biological processes such as in cellular communication or disease progression. Carbohydrates are also used as vaccines and pharmaceuticals. Their synthesis through glycosylation reactions is challenging, and often stoichiometric amounts of promoters are required. Transition metal catalyzed glycosylation reactions are far less common, but can have advantages with respect to reaction conditions and selectivity. The review intends to approach the topic from the catalysis and carbohydrate perspective to encourage researchers from both the fields to perform research in the area. The article covers the basics in glycosylation and catalysis chemistry. The catalysts for the reaction can be roughly divided into two groups. In one group, the catalysts serve as Lewis acids. In the other group, the catalysts play a higher sophisticated role, are involved in all elementary steps of the mechanism and remain coordinated to the substrate throughout the whole catalytic cycle. Based on selected examples, the main trends in transition metal catalyzed glycosylation reactions are explained. Lewis acid catalysts tend to require a somewhat higher catalyst load compared to other organometallic catalysts. The reaction conditions such as the temperature and time depend in many cases on the leaving group employed. An outlook is also presented. The article is not meant to be comprehensive; it outlines the most common transition metal catalyzed processes with the intention to bring the catalysis and carbohydrate communities together and to inspire research activities in both areas.",,33146654.0,['Glycosylation'],

However, the ferrocenium cation is not very stable in solution, which may potentially hamper catalytic applications. In an effort to stabilize ferrocenium-type architectures by inserting a bridge between the cyclopentadienyl rings, we investigated two ferrocenophanium (or ansa-ferrocenium) cations with respect to their stability and catalytic activity in propargylic substitution reactions. One of the ferrocenophanium complexes was characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Cyclic voltammetry experiments of the ferrocenophane parent compounds were performed in the absence and presence of alcohol nucleophiles, and the stability of the cations in solution was judged based on the reversibility of the electron transfer. The experiments revealed a moderate stabilizing effect of the bridge, albeit the effect is not very pronounced or straightforward. Catalytic propargylic substitution test reactions revealed decreased activity of the ferrocenophanium cations compared to the ferrocenium cation. It appears that the somewhat stabilized ferrocenophanium cations show decreased catalytic activity.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Study Design:  A. thaliana plants were grown from seedlings in PNS media in the absence or presence of one of 21 SATs.&#x0D;
Place and Duration of Study: Departments of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, University of Missouri – St. Louis, 1 University Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63121 U. S. A. The study was conducted 2017-2018.&#x0D;
Methodology: Twenty one compounds of the form R2N-COCH2YCH2CO-(Aaa)3Pro(Aaa)3-O(CH2)6CH3 were prepared and studied. The amino acids included Ala, Gly, and Ser. R was normal alkyl having 6, 10, 12, or 18 carbons. Y was methylene, oxygen, sulfur, or absent. The PNS media was infused with various concentrations of the SAT and 21 plants in each group were allowed to grow for 11 days. Overall plant growth and root morphology were visualized and/or measured and the results recorded.&#x0D;
Results: A comparison of primary root length and lateral root number revealed that the greatest alterations in lateral root densities were observed for peptide sequences of the type GGGPSGS, whether or not serine was protected by t-butyl. Differences were also observed for these peptide sequences according to the identity of Y in the ~COCH2YCH2CO~ chain.&#x0D;
Conclusion: The presence of serine’s oxygen atoms on the C-terminal side of the heptapeptide interact with Cl¯ leading to a change in ion concentrations and alterations in primary root lengths and lateral root densities.",,,,

Our perspectives come from a virtual town hall hosted by the Community Innovation and Action Center (CIAC) at the University of Missouri, St. Louis on April 18, 2020. Based on these initial public discussions, we use St. Louis as a lens for arguing that government’s attenuated impact is not due to a natural disaster itself, but the inevitable result of race-based policies that had worked against Black peoples over generations. The real failure involves our federalist system’s lack of a commitment to racial equity—when race no longer is used to predict life outcomes, and outcomes for all groups are improved—when designing the federal plan to respond to COVID-19 in local communities.

Nowhere is this currently more apparent than in the cities of Ferguson and Baltimore. It is not the civil unrest itself, but the resulting rioting and intentional violence that can create a disaster situation. This increases the care burden of health care providers during times when the governmental structure may be overwhelmed or functioning in a less than optimal manner. Beginning with the death of Michael Brown, civil unrest over the last 2 years has necessitated a closer examination of the role nurse leaders play in preparing their staff and facilities for potential results of this civil unrest. The similarities between the results of rioting and violence and natural disaster are obvious, but the differences are significant. Without adequate preparation, providers may not offer the appropriate response. Attention to the 10 “musts” for preparedness for civil unrest will facilitate a planning process and provide for a better response and recovery when communities face these issues.",cc-by-nc-4.0,,,

Some research has demonstrated that more severe coercion within unwanted sex is associated with more negative cognitions (particularly self-blame) following the unwanted sex, but findings are inconsistent. Previous research also has demonstrated that individuals’ perceptions of how much they consented to sex—regardless of the level of coercion—are associated with negative cognitions. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential moderating role of perceived consent in the relationship between sexual coercion severity and negative cognitions following unwanted sex. Participants ( N = 196) who had had a distressing unwanted sexual experience provided descriptions of their most distressing experience, rated their perceptions of how much they consented to this experience, and completed a questionnaire measuring the amount and content of negative cognitions they experienced following this experience. Two independent raters coded descriptions to determine coercion severity. Results demonstrated that perceived consent significantly moderated the relationship between coercion severity and two types of negative cognitions: characterological self-blame and negative thoughts about the world. This suggests that individuals’ perceptions of their consent are often as important as the level of coercion involved in predicting cognitive outcomes of unwanted sex. ",,,,

This study sought to examine the relationship between proximity to community violence and mental health in both community members and police officers. We recruited 565 adults (community, n = 304, and police, n = 261) exposed to the violence in Ferguson to complete measures of proximity to violence, posttraumatic stress, depression, and anger. Using structural equation modeling, we assessed aspects of proximity to violence—connectedness, direct exposure, fear from exposure, media exposure, reactions to media, and life interruption—as correlates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, and anger. The final model yielded (n = 432), χ2(d = 12) = 7.4, p = .830; comparative fit index = 1.0, root mean square error of approximation = 0 [0, .04]. All aspects of proximity except direct exposure were associated with mental health outcomes. There was no moderation as a function of community versus police. Race moderated the relationship between life interruptions and negative outcomes; interruption was related to distress for White, but not Black community members. Based on group comparisons, community members reported more symptoms of PTSD and depression than law enforcement (ηp2 = .06 and .02, respectively). Black community members reported more PTSD and depression than White community members (ηp2 = .05 and .02, respectively). Overall, distress was high, and mental health interventions are likely indicated for some individuals exposed to the Ferguson events.",,,,

An online study of 564 individuals demonstrated that a wide variety of behaviors were considered to be masturbation by a majority of participants. No difference was found between men and women in the total number of behaviors labeled as masturbation. Both men and women were more likely to label a behavior as masturbation (1) if there was no sexual partner present than if there was and (2) if an orgasm occurred than if it did not. In addition, women were more likely than men to label a behavior as masturbation if they were alone and if no orgasm occurred. Younger age was associated with labeling more behaviors as masturbation, but sexual identity, self-pleasuring experience, partnered sexual experience, and attitudes toward masturbation were not related to the number of behaviors labeled as masturbation.

Without a widely used warning system to alert the public, officials used social media as one warning information outlet to encourage rapid, large-scale evacuations. Tweets (N = 1,338) published by 109 media and government Twitter accounts on the day of the fire were examined for risk messaging components and coded according to which components were included. The risk messaging components used were derived from the Protective Action Decision Model and the Extended Parallel Process Model. Tweets from the National Weather Service in Boulder were evaluated using recommendations from NOAA’s Hazard Risk Communication guide. Some types of environmental cues improved several engagement metrics for tweets from media, and emergency managers and first responders. Social cues only effected engagement for local media accounts, though there were mixed results depending on the variables included in the regression model. Inclusion of actionable information boosted engagement for government officials, though this result also depended on which variables were included in the model. Inclusion of threat information improved some or all engagement metrics for journalists, local newspapers and non-traditional news websites, government, and emergency management accounts. The National Weather Service fulfilled the eleven recommendations from NOAA’s HRC guide that were used in this research, and the use of lively language, vivid images, empathy, and the “all-clear” were noted among the well-performing tweets. This study provides helpful information to those posting on social media in an official capacity during a wildfire by examining how risk communication theory and recommendations performed in a real-world scenario.",cc-by,,,

Specifically, we examine the extent to which external observers exhibit weight‐based biases against organizational leaders based on types of information that commonly appear in the media (e.g., a portrait and description of unit performance). Based on implicit leadership theory, we examine perceptions of leader prototypicality and ratings of leader effectiveness, as predicted by the interacting effects of leader body fat, leader gender, and the performance of the leader's work unit. Our sample consisted of 437 U.S. adults, recruited through Mturk, who evaluated fictitious leaders. Results suggested that leaders were, indeed, subject to statistically significant weight penalties in perceived leader effectiveness, which operated indirectly via decreased perceptions of leader prototypicality. These weight penalties were significantly increased for both man and woman leaders when unit performance was poor. In terms of credit/blame for unit performance, woman leaders with higher body fat received significantly more blame for unit failure, and less credit for unit success, than their counterparts with lower body fat. Overall, results suggest that external observers seem to exhibit weight‐based biases against leaders, particularly when other information can be used to justify negative evaluations.",,,,

Dementia and cognitive decline from other etiologies (e.g., stroke, brain injury) can also impair driving abilities, so it is important to understand their potential consequences. The crash histories of 1,691 drivers from Missouri reported to state authorities from various sources in 2001 to 2005 as having cognitive impairment and 11,615 age- and gender-matched controls were compared. The results showed that about 30% of the cognitively impaired drivers had been in a crash in the 3 years before being reported to state authorities, compared with only 7% of controls in the same period. Cognitively impaired drivers who crashed were also found to be more often involved in multiple crashes [19.8% Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 21.5% cognitive impairment, 30.3% brain injury] than the controls (8%). Cognitively impaired drivers were in significantly more fatal and disabling injury crashes (4.7% AD, 4.3% cognitive impairment, 7% brain injury) than controls (2.7%). Earlier identification of cognitive impairment and intervention for driver fitness may reduce the frequency of crashes for older drivers. The challenges of those who turn out to be medically unfit to drive must be addressed with improved transportation support. ",,,,

A structured interview was administered separately to parents and children, coded for legacy examples (i.e., those unique to the parent, overlapping, unique to the child), and analyzed with respect to expectations of similarity reported by each participant. Most predicted moderate to high overlap in mutual understanding of parent legacy. This was not the case, as there were far more unique legacy examples given than shared. Pairs agreed least with respect to material legacies, with half showing no agreement. All reported finding the structured discussion of legacy to be beneficial, with some indicating an intention to continue these discussions further.

A three-level rating (likely capable, unclear, not capable) was collapsed into two outcomes (0 likely capable; 1 unclear, not capable) as the dependent variable. Independent variables (predictors) were age, sex, driving exposure, recent crash or police action, number of medical conditions, medication side effects, driver insight, and disease functional severity rating for driving.<h4>Results</h4>Three variables in the model (Nagelkerke coefficient of determination = 0.64; P < .001) were significant in the expected direction: disease functional severity for driving (odds ratio (OR = 6.65), insight (OR = 2.35), and age (OR = 1.06). Proportionately more drivers rated likely capable (73%) passed the road test than those rated unclear or not capable (62%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Judgments of disease severity, decrements in driver insight, and older age influenced clinician ratings of driving capability.

We consider (LiBH4)n nanoclusters with n = 2 to 12 as reactants, while the possible products include (Li)n, (B)n, (LiB)n, (LiH)n and Li2BnHn; off-stoichiometric LinBnHm (m ≤ 4n) clusters were considered for n = 2, 3 and 6. Cluster ground-state configurations have been predicted using prototype electrostatic ground-state (PEGS) and genetic algorithm (GA) based structural optimizations. Free-energy calculations show hydrogen release pathways markedly differ from those in bulk LiBH4. While experiments have found that the bulk material decomposes into LiH and B, with Li2B12H12 as a kinetically inhibited intermediate phase, (LiBH4)n nanoclusters with n ≤ 12 are predicted to decompose into mixed LinBn clusters via a series of intermediate clusters of LinBnHm (m ≤ 4n). The calculated pressure-composition isotherms and temperature-pressure isobars exhibit sloping plateaus due to finite size effects on reaction thermodynamics. Generally, decomposition temperatures of free-standing clusters are found to increase with decreasing cluster size due to thermodynamic destabilization of reaction products.",cc-by-4.0,,,

We argue that racial identity links social context to individual valuations of law enforcement, moderating the association between specific encounters and general views on police legitimacy and effectiveness. These propositions are assessed using data from a sample of 451 Black and Latino/a youth in New York City. Findings lend partial support for the hypothesis that, for youth with a strong racial/ethnic identity, the detrimental consequences of more “coercive” stops and stops seen as disrespectful are amplified for valuations of legitimacy but not of effectiveness. We discuss these findings in the context of emerging work connecting race, law, and procedural justice at the micro- and macrolevels.",,,,

               Warrants are commonplace in the USA, especially bench warrants issued for non-compliance with court orders. Although warrants compel arrest, in practice, officers exercise discretion when enforcing low-level warrants; yet, this discretion goes undocumented and data on warrant enforcement are limited. This collaboration between St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department and the University of Missouri—St. Louis addresses these gaps. Using arrest data, we find that warrant arrests in St. Louis declined from 2002 to 2019. One-third of arrests involve a bench warrant, primarily stemming from traffic violations, and many involve no new charges. Racial disparities in warrant enforcement exist, but data are needed to uncover why. Informal focus groups and meetings with St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department personnel held from 2018 to 2021 provide insight into the role of warrants in officer decision making. We argue that reducing resources devoted to warrant enforcement and racial disparities requires collaboration between police and other stakeholders.",,,,

Limited attention, however, has been given to potential contingencies in this relationship. The aim of this research is to extend previous school-based studies by examining whether and to what extent school context is differentially predictive of violent delinquency for immigrant and nonimmigrant youth. Using two waves of data from two multicity program evaluations, Teens, Crime, and the Community/Community Works (T.C.C./C.W.) and the Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) program, we assess the impact of four measures of school climate on violent delinquency.

Less is known about the role of personal encounters with police. We explore this issue by specifying associations between reporting intentions and type of contact (involuntary/voluntary), scope (cumulative/recent), and appraisal (respect/satisfaction with last encounter). Methods: This study draws on surveys of young adults in New York City ( N = 508) and uses structural equation modeling to examine correlates of crime reporting intentions. Results: Respondents with more stops are less willing to report, and this effect is both direct and indirect, operating primarily via legitimacy. The association between reporting intentions and variety of voluntary contacts is direct and positive. Negative appraisals of recent stops are associated with lower reporting intentions but only indirectly; feelings of disrespect in recent stops are mediated by perceptions of legitimacy. Dissatisfaction with a recent voluntary contact is related to negative views of police effectiveness, but effectiveness does not shape reporting intentions. Instead, disrespectful voluntary contact has a direct negative relationship with reporting attitudes. Conclusion: The results underscore the importance of better-specifying contact with the police, as reporting intentions and related perceptions of law enforcement vary across experience and appraisal mechanisms.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether political skill and ambition interact with narcissism to attenuate or exacerbate workplace deviance.Design/methodology/approachThe authors surveyed a sample of 335 participants in leadership positions and empirically tested interactions among political skill, narcissism and ambition in predicting workplace deviance.FindingsThe authors performed moderated hierarchical regression analyses on the data to test the hypothesis and research question. Contrary to expectations, political skill attenuated the relationship between narcissism and workplace deviance. However, ambition was found to attenuate deviance, with the highest levels of deviance evident when narcissism was high, political skill was low, and ambition was also low.Originality/valueAlthough research has examined the relationship between narcissism and workplace deviance, to the authors’ knowledge, the study is the first to examine the roles of political skill and ambition in attenuating the manifestation of narcissism into workplace deviance.",,,,

In this study, the work ethic of correctional officers (COs) was examined. Compared with other occupational samples, COs generally endorsed higher levels of work ethic across several of the dimensions. Also, we found that the measurement properties of the Multidimensional Work Ethic Scale–Short Form (MWEP-SF) were comparable to those presented in previous studies. Implications for future research and the relevance of work ethic in a corrections context are discussed. In addition, study limitations and future directions are addressed. ",,,,

In response, some high-profile organizations have decided to eliminate performance ratings altogether as a solution to the growing disenchantment. Adler et al. (2016) offer arguments both in support of and against eliminating performance ratings in organizations. Although both sides of the debate in the focal article make some strong arguments both for and against utilizing performance ratings in organizations, we believe there continue to be misunderstandings, mischaracterizations, and misinformation with respect to some of the measurement issues in PM. We offer the following commentary not to persuade readers to adopt one particular side over another but as a call to critically reconsider and reevaluate some of the assumptions underlying measurement issues in PM and to dispel some of the pervasive beliefs throughout the performance rating literature.",,,,

In previous research, smoking media literacy (SML) has been associated with these variables, even when controlling for other known risk factors for smoking. However, these studies were performed with older teenagers, often in high school, not younger teens at a crucial developmental point with respect to the decision to begin smoking.METHODSThis study uses survey data collected from 656 American public middle school students representing multiple zip codes, schools, and school districts.RESULTSSmoking media literacy levels for middle school students were similar to those of high school students in earlier studies. Higher SML levels were associated with lower susceptibility to future smoking and predicted susceptibility to smoke when controlling for other risk factors. This suggests that the same relationships found with teenagers may exist with middle school students.CONCLUSIONSAlthough follow‐up studies using larger and more controlled administrations of the SML scale are warranted, this study suggests the utility of the SML framework and scale in the development and investigation of media literacy as a prevention strategy in students this age.",,,,

The CCC is a component of two distinct complexes, the cleavage/polyadenylation complex and the complex that processes nonpolyadenylated histone pre-mRNAs. RNAi-depletion of CCC factors in Drosophila culture cells causes reduction of CCC processing activity on histone mRNAs, resulting in read through transcription. In contrast, RNAi-depletion of factors only required for histone mRNA processing allows use of downstream cryptic polyadenylation signals to produce polyadenylated histone mRNAs. We used Dmel-2 tissue culture cells stably expressing tagged CCC components to determine that amino acids 272-1080 of Symplekin and the C-terminal approximately 200 amino acids of both CPSF73 and CPSF100 are required for efficient CCC formation in vivo. Additional experiments reveal that the C-terminal 241 amino acids of CPSF100 are sufficient for histone mRNA processing indicating that the first 524 amino acids of CPSF100 are dispensable for both CCC formation and histone mRNA 3' end processing. CCCs containing deletions of Symplekin lacking the first 271 amino acids resulted in dramatic increased use of downstream polyadenylation sites for histone mRNA 3' end processing similar to RNAi-depletion of histone-specific 3' end processing factors FLASH, SLBP, and U7 snRNA. We propose a model in which CCC formation is mediated by CPSF73, CPSF100, and Symplekin C-termini, and the N-terminal region of Symplekin facilitates cotranscriptional 3' end processing of histone mRNAs.",cc-by-nc,26081560.0,"['Drosophila', 'Cpsf100', 'Symplekin', 'Mrna 3′ End Processing', 'Cotranscriptional', 'Cpsf73', 'Animals', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors', 'Cleavage And Polyadenylation Specificity Factor', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Histones', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', 'Polyadenylation', 'Mutation', 'CPSF100 protein, Drosophila', 'CPSF73 protein, Drosophila', 'Sym protein, Drosophila']",PMC4509931

Stevens'}]",International Journal of Language and Culture,10.1075/ijolc.00035.mil,journal-article,"['2214-3157', '2214-3165']",IJoLC,IJoLC,John Benjamins Publishing Company,1,8,62-83,2021-06-07,['Multidisciplinary'],"Abstract
                Japanese visual aesthetics as represented in traditional arts such as flower arranging, calligraphy and tea
                    ceremony have long been celebrated or even emulated as exemplary expressions of beauty. The Japanese term
                        utsukushii (beautiful) can be used to describe a wide variety of pleasing aspects of daily life, ranging from
                    the human form to nature and even the gustatory experience. This article outlines traditional notions of beauty in the Japanese
                    language, sketching forward to more contemporary expressions of visual culture that cluster around the term
                        kawaii. This word is often translated as “cute” in English, but we maintain that kawaii
                    extends well beyond its denotative sense to encompass a more complex spectrum of meanings. For example, it can be used to describe
                    objects and practices which have both sentimental charm as well as dark humour. We argue that the kawaii
                    aesthetic has been successful because it serves important emotional and social functions. Finally, the differences between the
                    terms utsukushii and kawaii are gendered and class based, with kawaii often
                    providing a democratic expression of resistance to gendered processes of aging, ideas of class and taste, and attractiveness in
                    Japan’s postmodern society. This essay begins with an overview of the semantic meanings of the concepts of beauty and cuteness in
                    Japanese, followed by a discussion focused on the historical antecedents of the Japanese notion of cuteness. The third section
                    shifts to an analysis of the expansion of the kawaii concept in post-war society and its socio-cultural
                    functions. The essay closes with exploration of a few of the hybrid offshoots derived from kawaii, demonstrating
                    that concepts of beauty in Japan are constantly changing and reacting to social and historical trends.",,,,

As this neurodevelopmental disability increases in visibility, disparities in its diagnostic rate grow. Female and Black populations in the United States have historically lower prevalence, are diagnosed later, are more likely to have co-occurring intellectual disability, and experience exclusion from research. Autistic Black girls are effectively invisible in the literature. To combat this exclusion, this narrative review discusses intersectionality theory and how it may be used to provide integrated models that are inclusive toward diverse gender, ability, and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Systemic inequalities, including prenatal care and misdiagnosis, disproportionately negatively impact the quality of care available to female and Black autistic populations. The authors recommend that research include autistic populations with co-occurring intellectual disability, include a diagnostic evaluation as part of protocols, and clinically, universal screening and improved provider competence and confidence in working with diverse autistic populations. Lay abstract Although the prevalence of autism has been rising in recent years, disparities in diagnosis still remain. Female and Black populations in the United States are diagnosed later, are more likely to have an intellectual disability, and are excluded from research as well as services designed for autistic individuals. Autistic Black girls are effectively invisible in the current scientific literature. Intersectional theory, which looks at a person as a whole, examines models that are inclusive toward diverse gender, ability, and racial/ethnic backgrounds. This theory may be a useful approach to clinical and research work with autism so that practitioners may be most effective for the whole population of autistic people. The authors recommend research focusing on inclusion of autistic populations with intellectual disability and research studies that include evaluations as part of the procedure. Clinically, the authors recommend a focus on screening all young children for autism and improving provider knowledge in working with diverse autistic populations. ",,,,

In this essay, I first consider potential reasons for criminology's limited role in studying war and make the case for why war warrants a more central place in criminological discourse. Subsequently, I trace some of criminology's early contributions to the study of war in two domains—(a) legal responses to war and (b) the link between war and crime—and reflect upon ways in which the discipline can both broaden its purview and draw from its own intellectual history to engage more critically with the subject of war.",,,,

The status of the backbeat as not only metrically consonant but a defining feature of rock meter is discussed within the context of dual-aspect meter. Operating from the assumption that isochronous snare drum hits in rock are heard as a backbeat, placing those snare drum hits on beats other than 2 and 4 creates a particular kind of metrical dissonance, which I refer to as a backbeat switch. I examine two ways in which a backbeat switch occurs, the quick flip and the polymetric pogo. A quick flip usually occurs at a phrase break, where the drummer apparently (but intentionally) “drops a beat” and then resumes the backbeat pattern, thus shifting it “to the left.” A polymetric pogo involves a situation where the backbeat-insistent drummer is pitted against the rest of the band playing in an odd-cardinality meter, resulting in snare hits that bounce back and forth between even-numbered beats and odd-numbered beats every other measure. Short examples by The Cars, Paul Weller, Steve Vai, and Sting are used to demonstrate the article’s fundamental concepts, and longer examples by Tesla, Jerry Goldsmith, and Extreme place these concepts into larger contexts.",publisher-specific-oa,,,

In his foreword to the published score, Husa describes Prague’s use of the Hussite war song “Ktož jsú boží bojovníc” as its most important unifying motive. He says this song has long been “a symbol of resistance and hope.” The author does not debate the work’s nationalistic intent, he finds remarkable that, in 1968, Husa was an American citizen, teaching at Cornell, and using compositional techniques not frequently associated with Eastern European nationalism. If musical nationalism (expressed by folkloric elements) in Eastern European countries can be used to express primacy over avantgarde music, Music for Prague 1968 presents the opposite — a traditional war song submersed in an entirely Western European/American musical language. The study examines several portions of the composition to demonstrate the ways in which Husa expresses his nationalism in a non-nationalistic manner, including chromatic transformations of the Hussite song; the integrally serial third movement, in which unpitched percussion instruments are intended to represent the church bells of Prague; and the opening movement’s non-tonal bird calls, intended to represent freedom. Furthermore, Music for Prague 1968 uses a Western avant-garde language in a way that Husa’s other overtly nationalistic post-emigration pieces (Twelve Moravian Songs, Eight Czech Duets, Evocations of Slovakia) do not. In this light, it will be seen that Music for Prague 1968 fills a special role in Husa’s nationalistic display.",,,,

Comparing Subcutaneous Fluid Infusion to Intravenous Fluid Infusion in Children,2013.0,"[{'given': 'Laura L', 'family': 'Kuensting', 'name': 'Laura L Kuensting'}]",Journal of emergency nursing,10.1016/j.jen.2012.04.017,journal-article,0099-1767,J Emerg Nurs,J Emerg Nurs,Elsevier BV,1,39,86-91,2013-01-01,['Emergency Nursing'],"<h4>Introduction</h4>This study examined subcutaneous (SC) infusion as a parenteral alternative for children with mild to moderate illness. The purpose was to compare the difference in infusion start time of parenteral fluid between an initial SC order and an initial intravenous (IV) order. In addition, the number of needlesticks a child received for each method was evaluated. This study also sought to address the following question: If SC fluids were given and an IV attempt was made later, did the administration of SC fluids enhance the success of venous cannulation?<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective descriptive design was used for review of medical records for 36 children from November 2008 to May 2010 who had received SC fluids only or received SC fluids after 2 or more failed IV attempts.<h4>Results</h4>The IV/SC group had significantly longer time to infusion (M = 97.33 minutes) than did the SC group (M = 20.95 minutes; U = .000; P < .001). The IV/SC group included the number of needlesticks for the intravenous attempts plus the needle stick needed for the subcutaneous infusion. A significant difference was found between the 2 groups (mean IV = 4.87; mean SC = 1; Z = .000; P < .001).<h4>Discussion</h4>In a child who is not seriously ill, SC infusions appear to facilitate the initiation of parenteral rehydration. SC infusions minimized the number of needlesticks a child endured. More study is needed to determine if SC fluids enhance success of subsequent venous cannulation.",,22831827.0,"['Humans', 'Dehydration', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Clinical Nursing Research', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Female', 'Male', 'Hypodermoclysis']",

               Purpose
                – This paper aims to provide an update to the risk management literature, as it compiles a survey of 65 recent theoretical and empirical studies on the topic. 
            
            
               Design/methodology/approach
                – This is a survey paper that summarizes recent theoretical and empirical research regarding the relationship between risk management and firm value. 
            
            
               Findings
                – Recent empirical evidence provides support for theoretical propositions in the literature that risk management increases firm value and returns, while reducing return and cash flow volatility. The results are largely consistent with early findings, and there have been significant empirical advances that address concerns regarding the endogeneity of risk management practices relative to corporate financial decisions. The literature has become broader and deeper, as there are now studies with larger sample sizes across more industries and geographic areas. 
            
            
               Practical implications
                – Firms that use sound risk management practices obtain higher valuations, achieve better financial performance and experience diminished costs of financial distress. Recent research has emerged regarding enterprise risk management and its potential for value creation and risk reduction. 
            
            
               Originality/value
                – The paper provides a new compilation and synthesis of recent theoretical and empirical research in risk management that addresses many of the limitations of prior research.

We construct a measure of shocks driven by news on market fundamentals to capture rational trading behavior and a measure of irrational trading behavior from excess skewness, excess kurtosis, and excess turnover. We find that herding causes deterioration in liquidity mainly by affecting order imbalance, whereas overtrading improves market liquidity by increasing market depth.

Using a bidirectional pairwise regression model, we found that the returns for banking and real estate not only predict market returns and returns for other industries but also predict industrial output growth. Since 2005, a shift in predictive ability from manufacturing to real estate has occurred, whereas banking has maintained consistent predictive power over the examined period. In the reverse direction, the stock market predicts the returns for mining and transportation. The predictive power of banking was amplified during the 2008 financial crisis; however, it decreased in 2015 due to turbulence in China's stock market. The market predictability of mining was enhanced in both periods. The in‐sample and out‐of‐sample tests suggest that certain industry predictability patterns remain to be exploited by China's stock market participants.",,,,

For the extensive time period from 2001 to 2011, we find that trades are highly informative, explaining about 80% of the innovation in the efficient price. Large trades are more informative than smaller trades. We observe a noticeable upward trend in the contribution of trades, but also notice large drops in price informativeness around the recent global financial crisis and the European debt crisis.

Switching the Backbeat: The Quick Flip and Polymetric Pogo in 1980s-era Rock Music,2022.0,"[{'given': 'Zachary', 'family': 'Cairns', 'name': 'Zachary Cairns'}]",Music Theory Online,10.30535/mto.28.1.2,journal-article,['1067-3040'],MTO,MTO,Society for Music Theory,1,28.0,,2022-03-01,['Music'],"This article explores manipulations of the nearly ever-present backbeat in rock music from the “long” 1980s. The status of the backbeat as not only metrically consonant but a defining feature of rock meter is discussed within the context of dual-aspect meter. Operating from the assumption that isochronous snare drum hits in rock are heard as a backbeat, placing those snare drum hits on beats other than 2 and 4 creates a particular kind of metrical dissonance, which I refer to as a backbeat switch. I examine two ways in which a backbeat switch occurs, the quick flip and the polymetric pogo. A quick flip usually occurs at a phrase break, where the drummer apparently (but intentionally) “drops a beat” and then resumes the backbeat pattern, thus shifting it “to the left.” A polymetric pogo involves a situation where the backbeat-insistent drummer is pitted against the rest of the band playing in an odd-cardinality meter, resulting in snare hits that bounce back and forth between even-numbered beats and odd-numbered beats every other measure. Short examples by The Cars, Paul Weller, Steve Vai, and Sting are used to demonstrate the article’s fundamental concepts, and longer examples by Tesla, Jerry Goldsmith, and Extreme place these concepts into larger contexts.",publisher-specific-oa,,,

Music for Prague 1968: A Display of Czech Nationalism from America,2015.0,"[{'given': 'Zachary', 'family': 'Cairns', 'name': 'Zachary Cairns'}]",Studia Musicologica,10.1556/6.2015.56.4.11,journal-article,"['1788-6244', '1789-2422']",Studia Musicologica,Studia Musicologica,Akademiai Kiado Zrt.,4,56.0,443-458,2015-12-01,,"As an overt response to the Soviet bloc invasion of Czechoslovakia, Karel Husa’s Music for Prague 1968 makes an obvious nationalistic statement. In his foreword to the published score, Husa describes Prague’s use of the Hussite war song “Ktož jsú boží bojovníc” as its most important unifying motive. He says this song has long been “a symbol of resistance and hope.” The author does not debate the work’s nationalistic intent, he finds remarkable that, in 1968, Husa was an American citizen, teaching at Cornell, and using compositional techniques not frequently associated with Eastern European nationalism. If musical nationalism (expressed by folkloric elements) in Eastern European countries can be used to express primacy over avantgarde music, Music for Prague 1968 presents the opposite — a traditional war song submersed in an entirely Western European/American musical language. The study examines several portions of the composition to demonstrate the ways in which Husa expresses his nationalism in a non-nationalistic manner, including chromatic transformations of the Hussite song; the integrally serial third movement, in which unpitched percussion instruments are intended to represent the church bells of Prague; and the opening movement’s non-tonal bird calls, intended to represent freedom. Furthermore, Music for Prague 1968 uses a Western avant-garde language in a way that Husa’s other overtly nationalistic post-emigration pieces (Twelve Moravian Songs, Eight Czech Duets, Evocations of Slovakia) do not. In this light, it will be seen that Music for Prague 1968 fills a special role in Husa’s nationalistic display.",,,,

Comparing Subcutaneous Fluid Infusion to Intravenous Fluid Infusion in Children,2013.0,"[{'given': 'Laura L', 'family': 'Kuensting', 'name': 'Laura L Kuensting'}]",Journal of emergency nursing,10.1016/j.jen.2012.04.017,journal-article,0099-1767,J Emerg Nurs,J Emerg Nurs,Elsevier BV,1,39.0,86-91,2013-01-01,['Emergency Nursing'],"<h4>Introduction</h4>This study examined subcutaneous (SC) infusion as a parenteral alternative for children with mild to moderate illness. The purpose was to compare the difference in infusion start time of parenteral fluid between an initial SC order and an initial intravenous (IV) order. In addition, the number of needlesticks a child received for each method was evaluated. This study also sought to address the following question: If SC fluids were given and an IV attempt was made later, did the administration of SC fluids enhance the success of venous cannulation?<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective descriptive design was used for review of medical records for 36 children from November 2008 to May 2010 who had received SC fluids only or received SC fluids after 2 or more failed IV attempts.<h4>Results</h4>The IV/SC group had significantly longer time to infusion (M = 97.33 minutes) than did the SC group (M = 20.95 minutes; U = .000; P < .001). The IV/SC group included the number of needlesticks for the intravenous attempts plus the needle stick needed for the subcutaneous infusion. A significant difference was found between the 2 groups (mean IV = 4.87; mean SC = 1; Z = .000; P < .001).<h4>Discussion</h4>In a child who is not seriously ill, SC infusions appear to facilitate the initiation of parenteral rehydration. SC infusions minimized the number of needlesticks a child endured. More study is needed to determine if SC fluids enhance success of subsequent venous cannulation.",,22831827.0,"['Humans', 'Dehydration', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Clinical Nursing Research', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Female', 'Male', 'Hypodermoclysis']",

               Purpose
                – This paper aims to provide an update to the risk management literature, as it compiles a survey of 65 recent theoretical and empirical studies on the topic. 
            
            
               Design/methodology/approach
                – This is a survey paper that summarizes recent theoretical and empirical research regarding the relationship between risk management and firm value. 
            
            
               Findings
                – Recent empirical evidence provides support for theoretical propositions in the literature that risk management increases firm value and returns, while reducing return and cash flow volatility. The results are largely consistent with early findings, and there have been significant empirical advances that address concerns regarding the endogeneity of risk management practices relative to corporate financial decisions. The literature has become broader and deeper, as there are now studies with larger sample sizes across more industries and geographic areas. 
            
            
               Practical implications
                – Firms that use sound risk management practices obtain higher valuations, achieve better financial performance and experience diminished costs of financial distress. Recent research has emerged regarding enterprise risk management and its potential for value creation and risk reduction. 
            
            
               Originality/value
                – The paper provides a new compilation and synthesis of recent theoretical and empirical research in risk management that addresses many of the limitations of prior research.

We construct a measure of shocks driven by news on market fundamentals to capture rational trading behavior and a measure of irrational trading behavior from excess skewness, excess kurtosis, and excess turnover. We find that herding causes deterioration in liquidity mainly by affecting order imbalance, whereas overtrading improves market liquidity by increasing market depth.

Using a bidirectional pairwise regression model, we found that the returns for banking and real estate not only predict market returns and returns for other industries but also predict industrial output growth. Since 2005, a shift in predictive ability from manufacturing to real estate has occurred, whereas banking has maintained consistent predictive power over the examined period. In the reverse direction, the stock market predicts the returns for mining and transportation. The predictive power of banking was amplified during the 2008 financial crisis; however, it decreased in 2015 due to turbulence in China's stock market. The market predictability of mining was enhanced in both periods.

Large trades are more informative than smaller trades. We observe a noticeable upward trend in the contribution of trades, but also notice large drops in price informativeness around the recent global financial crisis and the European debt crisis.

Since 2005, a shift in predictive ability from manufacturing to real estate has occurred, whereas banking has maintained consistent predictive power over the examined period. In the reverse direction, the stock market predicts the returns for mining and transportation. The predictive power of banking was amplified during the 2008 financial crisis; however, it decreased in 2015 due to turbulence in China's stock market. The market predictability of mining was enhanced in both periods.

               Purpose
                – This paper aims to provide an update to the risk management literature, as it compiles a survey of 65 recent theoretical and empirical studies on the topic. 
            
            
               Design/methodology/approach
                – This is a survey paper that summarizes recent theoretical and empirical research regarding the relationship between risk management and firm value. 
            
            
               Findings
                – Recent empirical evidence provides support for theoretical propositions in the literature that risk management increases firm value and returns, while reducing return and cash flow volatility. The results are largely consistent with early findings, and there have been significant empirical advances that address concerns regarding the endogeneity of risk management practices relative to corporate financial decisions. The literature has become broader and deeper, as there are now studies with larger sample sizes across more industries and geographic areas. 
            
            
               Practical implications
                – Firms that use sound risk management practices obtain higher valuations, achieve better financial performance and experience diminished costs of financial distress. Recent research has emerged regarding enterprise risk management and its potential for value creation and risk reduction. 
            
            
               Originality/value
                – The paper provides a new compilation and synthesis of recent theoretical and empirical research in risk management that addresses many of the limitations of prior research.

Our perspectives come from a virtual town hall hosted by the Community Innovation and Action Center (CIAC) at the University of Missouri, St. Louis on April 18, 2020. Based on these initial public discussions, we use St. Louis as a lens for arguing that government’s attenuated impact is not due to a natural disaster itself, but the inevitable result of race-based policies that had worked against Black peoples over generations. The real failure involves our federalist system’s lack of a commitment to racial equity—when race no longer is used to predict life outcomes, and outcomes for all groups are improved—when designing the federal plan to respond to COVID-19 in local communities.

Yet, do elected officials make it less difficult for some immigrants than others to secure employment in a state? Using U.S. temporary immigrant labor admissions data between 2006 and 2014, I examine the extent to which growth rates of main foreign‐born subgroups influence E‐Verify policies that require employers to authenticate the legal immigration status of employees. I find that state policymakers are less likely to enact E‐Verify policies in response to the growth of immigrants who work in specialty occupations (H‐1b visas). In contrast, the growth of immigrants working in nonspecialty occupations (H‐2a and H‐2b visas) increases the likelihood of enacting E‐Verify policies over time. The results suggest that policymakers release strict rules for employment only for highly educated immigrants who work in specialty occupations that offer higher paying salaries and career advancement opportunities. Disaggregating a monolithic foreign‐born population indicator into more specific class components provides an important contribution to public policy studies. Scholars will likely overlook the contrasting effects of specialty and nonspecialty immigrant workforce growth on policy decisions relating to immigrant employment.",,,,

We envision abolition work that uplifts not only asylum seekers but all people with lived experiences of coerced mobility.MethodsThrough the lenses of critical race, decolonial theory, and abolition, we conceptualize the asylum process beyond only one violent system that coerces the mobility of migrants.ResultsWe build a theory that extends scholarly conversations about asylum processes as a system of racial/colonial surveillance, control, and state‐sanctioned violence and that informs abolitionist practices.ConclusionIn order to eradicate all forms of detention, we must build robust strategies that demolish the pillars of white supremacy and rebuild new politics that reject the notion of freedom as a reward to well‐behaved people, resist coerced mobility, foster shared power arrangements in which people with lived experiences of oppression organize to help each other, and reorient a capitalist system that commoditizes and exploits people's oppression.

For Katz and colleagues, such markers function as introductory formulae, signaling to the addressee the intended interpretation of an incoming proverb. Inspired by their work, this paper explores the effects of marking, showing that some markers (<i>literally, in the full sense of the word, double entendre, really</i>) rather than disambiguating an ambiguous utterance, can allow for ambiguation (e.g., <i>S/he is radiant, in the full sense of the word</i> uttered in reference to a smiling person wearing sparkling clothes). Two offline questionnaire studies and one online reading task experiment, all conducted in Hebrew, test the <i>Low-Salience Marking Hypothesis</i> (Givoni, <i>Low-salience marking</i>, 2011; Givoni, <i>Marking multiple meanings,</i> 2020; Givoni, <i>Journal of Pragmatics</i>, 2013, 48, 29). Accordingly, such marking boosts low-salience meanings (""glittery"", here the literal meaning) which are less-frequent, less-familiar, less-prototypical, and less-conventionalized (The Graded Salience Hypothesis, see Giora, <i>Cognitive Linguistics,</i> 1997, 8, 183; Giora, <i>On our mind: Salience, context and figurative language</i>, Oxford University Press, 2003; Givoni & Giora, <i>Handbuch Pragmatik,</i> J.B. Metzler, 2018). Marked utterances were embedded in contexts, strongly supportive of the salient meaning of the ambiguities (""happy"", here the figurative meaning). Results support the <i>Low-Salience Marking Hypothesis.</i> They show preference for low-salience meanings as well as faster reading times of such meanings following low-salience marking relative to control conditions.

However, prior research has been limited by (1) the inability to account for endogenous factors that both funnel families into deprived neighborhoods and increase their likelihood of moving out, and (2) the failure to consider how the spatial distribution of socioeconomic deprivation in the broader community conditions the effect of local deprivation on mobility. This paper attends to this gap in the literature by examining how changes in socioeconomic disadvantage between sending and receiving neighborhoods and the spatial patterning of deprivation in the areas surrounding destination neighborhoods influence future mobility among a representative sample of American adolescents. We employ a modeling strategy that allows us to examine the unique and separable effects of local and extralocal neighborhood disadvantage while simultaneously holding constant time-invariant factors that place some youth at a greater likelihood of experiencing a residential move. We find that moves to more impoverished neighborhoods decrease the likelihood of subsequent mobility and that this effect is most pronounced among respondents who move to neighborhoods surrounded by other similarly deprived neighborhoods. In this sense, geographical pockets of disadvantage strengthen the mobility-hampering effect of neighborhood deprivation on future mobility.",cc-by-4.0,,,

These challenges occur largely because behavior courses, like most organismal biology courses, often stress experiential learning through laboratories that involve live animals, as well as a lecture component that emphasizes formative assessment, discussion, and critical thinking. Although online behavior courses may be remote, they can still be interactive and social, and designed with inclusive pedagogy. Here, we discuss some of the key decisions that instructors should consider, provide recommendations, and point out new opportunities for student learning that stem directly from the move to online instruction. Specific topics include challenges related to generating an inclusive and engaging online learning environment, synchronous versus asynchronous formats, assignments that enhance student learning, testing format and execution, grade schemes, design of laboratory experiences including opportunities for community science, design of synthetic student projects, and workload balance for students and instructors. We designed this primer both for animal behavior instructors who need to quickly transition to online teaching in the midst of a pandemic, and for those facing such transitions in upcoming terms. Much of the manuscript's content should also be of general interest and value to instructors from all areas of organismal biology who are attempting to quickly transition to online teaching.",pd,,,

Certain drivers of these declines are known; however, less is known about the interspecific trait differences that make certain species more susceptible to decline. Two traits that have implications for responding to rapidly changed environments may be particularly consequential for bumble bee populations: intraspecific body size variation and brain size. Bumble bee body size is highly variable and is likely adaptive at the colony level, and brain size correlates with cognitive traits (e.g., behavioral plasticity) in many groups. Trait variation and plasticity may buffer species against negative effects of rapidly changed environments. Using phylogenetically controlled analyses of 31 North American bumble bee species, we find that higher intraspecific body size variation is associated with species having increased their relative abundance over time. However, this variation does not significantly interact with tongue length, another trait thought to influence bees' decline susceptibility. Head size, a proxy for brain size, is not correlated with change in relative abundance. Our results support the hypothesis that variation in body size makes species less susceptible to decline in rapidly altered environments and suggests that this variation is important to the success of bumble bee populations.",,31553221.0,"['Behavioral Plasticity', 'Pollinator Decline', 'Trait Variation', 'Museum Data', 'Human-induced Rapid Environmental Change', 'International Union For Conservation Of Nature (Iucn)', 'Tongue', 'Brain', 'Animals', 'Bees', 'Body Size', 'Adaptation, Physiological', 'Phylogeny', 'Biological Variation, Population']",

Theory suggests that the value of collecting information, or sampling, depends on environmental persistence and on the relative costs of making wrong decisions. However, empirical tests of how these variables interact are lacking. We tested whether bumblebee foraging decisions are indeed influenced by these two factors. We gave bees repeated choices between a resource providing a steady, mediocre reward and a resource fluctuating between a low reward and a high reward. In this paradigm, we manipulated environmental persistence by changing how long the quality of a fluctuating resource remained stable at one reward level. We manipulated the costs of decision errors by changing the relative values of the available rewards. Bees sampled the fluctuating resource more frequently when it changed quality more frequently, indicating that they measured environmental persistence and reacted to it as predicted by theory. Bees showed surprisingly suboptimal tracking, not reliably choosing the currently best resource except when the fluctuating resource was very persistent and the potential rewards high. While bees modify their choices in response to different levels of change and potential rewards, they do not always do so according to optimality predictions.",,,,

However, less known is whether such phenotypic variation is driven by plastic or adaptive responses to local environments. Here, we study five bumble bee (Apidae: Bombus) species across an urban gradient in the greater Saint Louis, Missouri region in the North American Midwest and ask: (1) Can urban environments induce intraspecific spatial structuring of body size, an ecologically consequential functional trait? And, if so, (2) is this body size structure the result of plasticity or adaptation? We additionally estimate genetic diversity, inbreeding, and colony density of these species—three factors that affect extinction risk. Using ≥ 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci per species and measurements of body size, we find that two of these species (Bombus impatiens, Bombus pensylvanicus) exhibit body size clines across the urban gradient, despite a lack of population genetic structure. We also reaffirm reports of low genetic diversity in B. pensylvanicus and find evidence that Bombus griseocollis, a species thought to be thriving in North America, is inbred in the greater Saint Louis region. Collectively, our results have implications for conservation in urban environments and suggest that plasticity can cause phenotypic clines across human-modified landscapes.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Masked priming has long been used to demonstrate the impact of brief presentations of orthographically related stimuli on visual word recognition. The aim of the present study was to examine neural correlates of orthographic priming produced by pronounceable and unpronounceable anagram primes. Crucially, we examined relationships between these priming effects and individual differences on a battery of measures assessing orthographic processing ability, current reading ability, and verbal intelligence in university students. Our study demonstrated group-level priming effects on the N200 and N400, with both components being primarily modulated by unpronounceable, orthographically illegal primes. Relationships between the extent of priming as indexed by N200 amplitude and speed of orthographic processing emerged, as reaction time (RT) on an orthographic choice task was associated with priming effects. Priming effects on N400 amplitude were related to phonological decoding efficiency. Those individuals with less efficient orthographic or phonological processing were more sensitive to the orthographic relationship between primes and targets. These findings demonstrate that university students vary in their sensitivity to orthographic priming and the degree to which orthographic information is used during word recognition. ",,,,

The aim of the present study was to examine how reading experience changes this effect. Specifically, we tested the prediction that top‐down visual modulation of spoken word recognition is reduced in children compared to adults, owing to their reduced experience with print. Event‐related potentials (ERPs) were measured as 8–10‐year‐old children and adults made rhyme decisions about spoken word pairs that were either orthographically similar or dissimilar. When orthography did not conflict (e.g., throat‐boat), both age groups demonstrated a robust rhyme effect marked by greater N400 to no‐rhyme versus rhyme trials. For rhyming trials that differed in orthography (e.g., vote‐boat) and non‐rhyming trials that shared orthography (e.g., warm‐farm), adults showed more interference than children. Differences in orthographic interference suggest an extended developmental schedule for top‐down mechanisms in speech recognition.",,,,

First, I propose a new conceptual analysis of precision health. I argue that precision health is defined primarily by targeted medical interventions and not by stratification, as others have asserted. Next, I argue that failure to be adequately responsive to this conceptual analysis explains common ethical abuses in the field. Third, I argue that this conceptual analysis can also pave the way for future research heretofore overlooked. Thus, we can limit abuses in precision health research and care while at the same time opening new avenues to help historically oppressed communities.",,,,

However, doctors have more direct control over women's health and quietly have been much more effective at preventing patients' access to contraception. Obstetrician/Gynecologists routinely deny their patients access to contraception ostensibly in the name of health by withholding birth control until patients undergo yearly pap smears. I argue that those in the medical field are motivated by similarly sexist concerns as those in other major institutions in the United States, but that they are often overlooked in discussions of biomedical ethics. After providing background, I argue that using birth control as a bargaining chip to control patients is morally impermissible, is paternalistic, and is contrary to consent. I next argue that sexism explains, though does not justify, this practice. I discuss the medical harms of routine pap smears and withholding birth control. These claims make medical malpractice likely.

            Background:
            As survival rates for infants born with severe forms of cardiac defects (congenital heart defect [CHD]) improve, attention is directed to evaluating factors that affect the child’s short- and long-term outcomes including parental quality of life (QOL).
          
          
            Purpose:
            The purpose of this review was to identify how parental QOL is affected when having a child with a CHD. Factors that influence parental QOL when having a child with a CHD will also be described.
          
          
            Methods:
            A systematic search of CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases was performed. Thirty-three quantitative cross-sectional or cohort studies were selected for inclusion and analyzed for quality reporting using Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.
          
          
            Results:
            Heart defect severity, age of child, perceived support, and availability of economic resources were identified as factors affecting parental QOL. Parent gender was related to QOL and family functioning factors. Paternal outcomes were reported in 23 of the 33 studies (70%), with an average father participation rate of 40%.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Having a child with CHD negatively affects parental QOL. Future research should include targeting fathers to improve understanding of their unique perceptions and needs. Longitudinal studies should also describe correlations of parental QOL with their child’s developmental outcomes. Efficacy studies testing supportive interventions on outcomes such as improved adjustment and QOL are needed.

To overcome this limitation, new warning signs for black ice were developed using materials that change color in response to different temperatures. The performance and effects of the new signs were investigated by conducting driver behavior analysis. To this end, driving simulator experiments were conducted with 37 participants for two different rural highway sections, i.e., a curve and a tangent. The analysis results of the driving behavior and visual behavior experiments showed that the conventional signs had insufficient performance in terms of inducing changes in driving behavior for safety. Meanwhile, the new signs actuated by weather conditions offered a statistically significant performance improvement. Typically, driver showed two times higher speed deceleration when they fixed eyes on the new weather-actuated warning sign (12.80 km/h) compared to the conventional old warning sign (6.84 km/h) in the curve segment. Accordingly, this study concluded that the new weather-actuated warning signs for black ice are more effective than the conventional ones for accident reduction during winters.",cc-by,35742797.0,"['Speeding', 'Hazard Perception', 'Visual Behavior', 'Driving Behavior', 'Eye Tracker', 'Road Signs Visibility', 'Static Warning Sign', 'Humans', 'Weather', 'Ice', 'Safety', 'Accidents, Traffic', 'Automobile Driving', 'Computer Simulation']",PMC9224529

Generally, the ultrasonic transducer is required to be perpendicular to the test sample surface when using the longitudinal wave. However, the transducer posture deviation (i.e., incident angle) of ultrasonic beam relative to the local surface normal is always inevitable. In addition, the received ultrasonic pressure will be weakened significantly because of the variation of echo propagation path and the attenuation of echo amplitude. As a result, the incident angle induced thickness error is generated. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate and quantify the negative effect of incident angle on ultrasonic thickness measurement. This paper focuses on the incident angle identification based on the first-echo energy attenuation. First, the influence mechanism of incident angle on pulse-echo pressure is analyzed theoretically by adopting an equivalent transducer model. Furthermore, a novel approach for the incident identification based on the first-echo energy attenuation is developed. A compensation model is established to correct the incident angle induced thickness error. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, a series of incident angle calibrations and experiments were designed using the developed ultrasonic pulse measurement system. It was indicated that the proposed angle identification and error compensation approach had the capacity to improve the measurement accuracy of ultrasonic thickness.",,30176585.0,,

The video data are excerpted from an ethnographic study of a computer club for primary school-aged children in an afterschool program serving working-class and middle-class families in a US Midwest university community. Discourses of schooling in the computer room and Webkinz complicated children’s goal of coordinated game play and mutual participation in online games.

After outlining the current definitions and longitudinal trends of desistance, we discuss contemporary theories and the studies that inform these theories. We use an organizational schema situating theories in terms of the primacy with which they place structural opportunities or subjective motivations in their explanations of the transition away from offending. We conclude by presenting avenues for advancing research in the areas of definitions, theoretical testing, and bridging the research-policy divide.",,,,

Methods: We investigate how marriage promotes desistance from crime among urban African American males raised in the Woodlawn community, a disadvantaged neighborhood in Chicago. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we test the resiliency of the marriage effect by observing offending trajectories following marital dissolution; is the marriage effect conditional upon staying married, indicating situational effects? or does the effect persist when marriage is taken away, indicating enduring effects? Further, we test if the process of desistance is conditional upon contextual disadvantage. Results: While initial findings show an increase in violent and property offending upon divorce, further analysis shows evidence that this effect differs by neighborhood structural context; the increase in offending upon divorce is apparent only for African American men who experience continued disadvantage across the life course. Those who moved to relatively more advantaged areas by adulthood show no increase in offending upon marital dissolution. Conclusions: How marriage matters for desistance is partially influenced by social structural position; context matters. These findings invigorate criminological research on the mechanisms driving the marriage effect and provide insight into the interactive nature of person and context. ",,,,

Recently, Microsoft announced the pending release of HoloLens, and Magic Leap filed a patent application for technology that will project light directly onto the wearer's retina. Here we explore the notion of deception in relation to the impact these devices have on developers, users, and non-users as they interact via these devices. These sorts of interactions raise questions regarding autonomy and suggest a strong need for informed consent protocols. We identify issues of ownership that arise due to the blending of physical and virtual space and important ways that these devices impact trust. Finally, we explore how these devices impact individual identity and thus raise the question of ownership of the space between an object and someone's eyes. We conclude that developers ought to take time to design and implement a natural and easy to use informed consent system with these devices.",,,,

The paper is motivated by the amount of research being done that attempts to imbue artificial agents with expertise in ethical decision-making. It seems clear that computing systems make decisions, in that they make choices between different options; and there is scholarship in philosophy that addresses the distinction between ethical decision-making and general decision-making. Essentially, the qualitative difference between ethical decisions and general decisions is that ethical decisions must be part of the process of developing ethical expertise within an agent. We use this distinction in examining publicity surrounding a particular experiment in which a simulated robot attempted to safeguard simulated humans from falling into a hole. We conclude that any suggestions that this simulated robot was making ethical decisions were misleading.",,27116039.0,"['decision-making', 'Artificial Agents', 'Ethical Expertise', 'Humans', 'Decision Making', 'Robotics']",

What must complement ongoing discussions is a broader, system level of analysis that engages with the interactions and effects that these cars will have on one another and on the socio-technical systems in which they are embedded. To bring the conversation of self-driving cars to the system level, we make use of two traffic scenarios which highlight some of the complexities that designers, policymakers, and others should consider related to the technology. We then describe three approaches that could be used to address such complexities and their associated shortcomings.

Fasting lipids and cholesterol distribution within low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles were measured at baseline (BL), 6 months, and 12 months.Results:Walkers had an 11% increase and nonwalkers a 7% decrease in HDL cholesterol from 6 to 12 months (P = .0367) without an effect on LDL cholesterol. Whereas nonwalkers had virtually no change in mean LDL particle size, walkers had a borderline reduction in LDL size from BL (268.7 ± 4.1 Å) to 6 months (266.9 ± 4.9 Å), followed by a significant increase in size by 12 months (269.7 ± 4.1 Å; P = .011). The proportion of cholesterol in large LDL particles decreased by 15% from BL to 6 months, but subsequently increased 25% by 12 months among walkers; changes among nonwalkers were smaller and in opposite direction (4% and –3%, respectively; P = .0004).Conclusions:Participation in the social-support PA intervention resulted in slightly increased HDL cholesterol concentrations and a modest and beneficial shift toward larger, less atherogenic LDL particles.",,,,

Further, the moderating role of gender identity and effects of stereotype threat on high achieving girls in math is unknown. This study tested the effects of a stereotype threat condition (vs. control group) among middle school girls in standard and honors math classes and examined gender identity as a moderator. Students ( N = 498) completed pre- and post-questionnaires and a math test as part of a stereotype threat experiment. Gender identity moderated effects of stereotype threat on math discounting, disengagement, attitudes, and performance, but whether gender identity was a protective or risk factor differed by math education context (honors math and standard math classes). Gender identity was protective for girls in honors math for attitudes, discounting, and disengagement but was a risk factor for math performance. Gender identity was a risk factor for disengagement and math attitudes among girls in standard math classes, but was a buffer for math performance. Results suggest the need to examine protective and risk properties of gender identity importance for adolescent girls and the need to examine stereotype threat within educational contexts. Stereotype threat can be reduced through interventions; thus, educators and practitioners can collaborate with social scientists to implement widespread interventions in K–12 schools.

Juniors, seniors, and postbaccalaureates who attended ABRCMS during 2008–2011 were emailed a link to an online questionnaire in which they reported their experiences at the conference. Attendees reported many ABRCMS-provided benefits. Frequency of attending or presenting at ABRCMS is positively related to science self-efficacy, research confidence, sense of belonging in science, and intentions to pursue a research degree in graduate school. Increased research confidence predicts graduate school plans and intentions for a research career in science; however, men were slightly more likely to intend to pursue a research career than women, likely due to higher research confidence. Although all attendees benefited from ABRCMS, underrepresented minority (URM) students had higher science self-efficacy and sense of belonging in science after attending ABRCMS than non-URM students. This finding demonstrates the effectiveness of ABRCMS as an intervention to increase the representation and success of URMs in science. Results highlight the importance of attending a minority-oriented research conference where URMs can develop their science self-efficacy, research confidence, and sense of belonging in science. However, changes to the conference and undergraduate research experiences may be necessary to reduce gender gaps. ",cc-by-nc-sa,,,

More alarmingly, these gender disparities worsen when examining women's representation within STEM departments in academia. While the number of women receiving postgraduate degrees has increased in recent years, the number of women in STEM faculty positions remains largely unchanged. One explanation for this lack of progress toward gender parity is negative and pervasive gender stereotypes, which may facilitate hiring discrimination and reduce opportunities for women's career advancement. Women in STEM also have lower social capital (e.g., support networks), limiting women's opportunities to earn tenure and learn about grant funding mechanisms. Women faculty in STEM may also perceive their academic climate as unwelcoming and threatening, and report hostility and uncomfortable tensions in their work environments, such as sexual harassment and discrimination. Merely the presence of gender-biased cues in physical spaces targeted toward men (e.g., ""geeky"" décor) can foster a sense of not belonging in STEM. We describe the following three factors that likely contribute to gender inequalities and women's departure from academic STEM fields: (a) numeric underrepresentation and stereotypes, (b) lack of supportive social networks, and (c) chilly academic climates. We discuss potential solutions for these problems, focusing on National Science Foundation-funded ADVANCE organizational change interventions that target (a) recruiting diverse applicants (e.g., training search committees), (b) mentoring, networking, and professional development (e.g., promoting women faculty networks); and (c) improving academic climate (e.g., educating male faculty on gender bias).",,33103281.0,"['Stem', 'Gender Inequality', 'Women Faculty', 'Humans', 'Mathematics', 'Science', 'Faculty', 'Universities', 'Engineering', 'Technology', 'Women', 'Female', 'Sexism', 'Gender Equity']",

Although women increasingly earn postgraduate degrees in the social sciences, women faculty still experience gender inequities. Consistent gender inequities include slower career advancement, blunted salaries, unequal workloads, work-life conflict, systemic gender biases, underrepresentation in positions of power, and hostile work environments. Cultural biases suggest that once women have achieved parity, gender bias no longer exists. This review challenges that notion by providing evidence from social science domains in which women are well-represented but continue to face systemic gender biases. We examine cultural influences on gender representation and career advancement in psychology, economics, political science, sociology, and anthropology. We make interdisciplinary comparisons of career trajectories and salaries using national data, documenting patterns across the social sciences. For example, women economists face gendered standards in publishing, and women political scientists are less likely to have their work cited than men. Furthermore, data show that salaries become stagnant as the representation of women in these fields increases. These disparities reflect cultural biases in perceptions of women’s competence stemming from social role theory. We discuss best practices to address these problems, focusing on the ADVANCE organizational change programs funded by the National Science Foundation that target (a) improving academic climate, (b) providing professional development, and (c) fostering social networking. Federally supported interventions can reveal systemic gender biases in academia and reduce gender disparities for women academics in the social sciences.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Such competition can select for divergence in floral traits that attract pollinators or determine pollen placement. While most species in Centropogon (Campanulaceae: Lobelioideae) have flowers that suggest adaptation to bat or hummingbird pollination, actual pollinators are rarely documented, and a few species have a mix of traits from both pollination syndromes. We studied the pollination biology of a ""mixed-syndrome"" species and its co-occurring congeners to examine the relationship between floral traits and visitation patterns for Centropogon.<h4>Methods</h4>Fieldwork at two sites in Bolivian cloud forests involved filming floral visitors, quantifying pollen transfer, and measuring floral traits. Stamen exsertion, which determines pollen placement, was measured from herbarium specimens across the geographic range of these species to test for character displacement.<h4>Results</h4>Results show a generalization gradient, from primarily bat pollination in white-flowered Centropogon incanus, to bat pollination with secondary hummingbird pollination in the cream-flowered C. brittonianus, to equal reliance on both pollinators in the red-flowered, mixed-syndrome C. mandonis. Pollen transfer between these species is further reduced by differences in stamen exsertion that are accentuated in zones of sympatry, a pattern consistent with character displacement.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results demonstrate that key differences in floral color and shape mediate a gradient of specialization in Bolivian Centropogon. Interspecific pollen transfer is further reduced by potential character displacement of a key trait.

Plants sometimes suffer mechanical injury. The nonlethal collapse of a flowering stalk, for example, can greatly reduce plant fitness if it leads to ‘incorrect’ floral orientation and thus reduced visitation or poor pollination. When floral orientation is important for accurate pollination, as has been suggested for bilaterally symmetrical flowers, we predict that such flowers should have developmental and/or behavioural mechanisms for restoring ‘correct’ orientation after accidents.

We made observations and conducted experiments on 23 native and cultivated flowering plant species in Australia, South America, North America and Europe.

We found that flowers with bilateral symmetry usually have the capacity to reorient after accidents, and that this is manifested through rapid bending and/or rotation of pedicels or sexual organs or slower peduncle bending. Floral reorientation restores pollination accuracy and fit with pollinators. However, experimental floral misorientation in eight species with radially symmetrical flowers showed that, with one exception, they had little capacity to reorient their flowers, in line with expectations that the orientation of radially symmetrical flowers does not substantially affect pollination accuracy.

Our results suggest that quick corrective reorientation of bilaterally symmetrical flowers is adaptive, highlighting a little‐studied aspect of plant–pollinator interactions and plant evolution.

Previous studies have given conflicting results regarding the significance of pollination mode, seed dispersal mode, mating system, growth form and latitudinal region in shaping patterns of genetic structure, as estimated by FST values, and no study to date has tested their relative importance together across a broad scale. Here, we assembled a 337‐species data set for seed plants from publications with data on FST from nuclear markers and species traits, including variables pertaining to the sampling scheme of each study. We used species traits, while accounting for sampling variables, to perform phylogenetic multiple regressions. Results demonstrated that FST values were higher for tropical, mixed‐mating, non‐woody species pollinated by small insects, indicating greater population differentiation, and lower for temperate, outcrossing trees pollinated by wind. Among the factors we tested, latitudinal region explained the largest portion of variance, followed by pollination mode, mating system and growth form, while seed dispersal mode did not significantly relate to FST. Our analyses provide the most robust and comprehensive evaluation to date of the main ecological factors predicted to drive population differentiation in seed plants, with important implications for understanding the basis of their genetic divergence. Our study supports previous findings showing greater population differentiation in tropical regions and is the first that we are aware of to robustly demonstrate greater population differentiation in species pollinated by small insects.",,,,

Pollinator type strongly impacts gene flow within and among plant populations for six Neotropical species,2023.0,"[{'given': 'Diana', 'family': 'Gamba', 'name': 'Diana Gamba'}, {'given': 'Nathan', 'family': 'Muchhala', 'name': 'Nathan Muchhala'}]",Ecology,10.1002/ecy.3845,journal-article,"['0012-9658', '1939-9170']",Ecology,Ecology,Wiley,1,104.0,,2023-01-01,"['Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics']","AbstractAnimal pollinators directly affect plant gene flow by transferring pollen grains between individuals. Pollinators with restricted mobility are predicted to limit gene flow within and among populations, whereas pollinators that fly longer distances are likely to promote genetic cohesion. These predictions, however, remain poorly tested. We examined population genetic structure and fine‐scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) in six perennial understory angiosperms in Andean cloud forests of northwestern Ecuador. Species belong to three families (Gesneriaceae, Melastomataceae, and Rubiaceae), and within each family we paired one insect‐pollinated with one hummingbird‐pollinated species, predicting that insect‐pollinated species have greater population differentiation (as quantified with the FST statistic) and stronger FSGS (as quantified with the SP statistic) than hummingbird‐pollinated species. We confirmed putative pollinators through a literature review and fieldwork, and inferred population genetic parameters with a genome‐wide genotyping approach. In two of the three species pairs, insect‐pollinated species had much greater (&gt;2‐fold) population‐level genetic differentiation and correspondingly steeper declines in fine‐scale genetic relatedness. In the Gesneriaceae pair, however, FST and SP values were similar between species and to those of the other hummingbird‐pollinated plants. In this pair, the insect pollinators are euglossine bees (as opposed to small bees and flies in the other pairs), which are thought to forage over large areas, and therefore may provide similar levels of gene flow as hummingbirds. Overall, our results shed light on how different animal pollination modes influence the spatial scale of plant gene flow, suggesting that small insects strongly decrease genetic cohesion.",,,,

                  Background and Aims
                  The centropogonid clade (Lobelioideae: Campanulaceae) is an Andean-centred rapid radiation characterized by repeated convergent evolution of morphological traits, including fruit type and pollination syndromes. While previous studies have resolved relationships of lineages with fleshy fruits into subclades, relationships among capsular species remain unresolved. This lack of resolution has impeded reclassification of non-monophyletic genera, whose current taxonomy relies heavily on traits that have undergone convergent evolution.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Targeted sequence capture using a probe-set recently developed for the centropogonid clade was used to obtain phylogenomic data from DNA extracted from both silica-dried and herbarium leaf tissue. These data were used to infer relationships among species using concatenated and partitioned species tree methods, and to quantify gene tree discordance.
               
               
                  Key Results
                  While silica-dried leaf tissue resulted in longer assembled sequence data, the inclusion of herbarium samples improved taxonomic representation. Relationships among baccate lineages are similar to those inferred in previous studies, although they differ for lineages within and among capsular clades. We improve the phylogenetic resolution of Siphocampylus, which forms ten groups of closely related species which we informally name. Two subclades of Siphocampylus and two individual species are rogue taxa whose placement differs widely across analyses. Gene tree discordance (including cytonuclear discordance) is rampant.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  This first phylogenomic study of the centropogonid clade considerably improves our understanding of relationships in this rapid radiation. Differences across analyses and the possibility of additional lineage discoveries still hamper a solid and stable reclassification. Rapid morphological innovation corresponds with a high degree of phylogenomic complexity, including cytonuclear discordance, nuclear gene tree conflict and well-supported differences between analyses based on different nuclear loci. Together, these results point to a potential role of hemiplasy underlying repeated convergent evolution. This hallmark of rapid radiations is probably present in many other species-rich Andean plant radiations.

This study uses an experimental vignette design to examine whether the type of violence employed and the gender dynamics within the couple (male perpetrator and female victim vs. female perpetrator and male victim) affect young adults’ perceptions of IPV normality. Gender differences in these perceptions are assessed and moreover, we explore whether these differences can be attributed to respondents’ prior IPV experiences. Young adults ( N = 599) were recruited from various schools and universities throughout the Netherlands. They were randomly assigned to one of 10 experimental vignettes. Findings demonstrate that, generally, scenarios describing more serious types of IPV as well as those describing a male perpetrator and a female victim received lower ratings of normality. Gender differences in perceptions were found and, moreover, the direction of these gender differences appeared to depend on the actual gender dynamics described in the IPV scenario. Prior IPV experiences increased perceptions of IPV normality among female respondents in particular. Moreover, the suggestion that respondents’ prior IPV experiences may better explain respondents’ IPV perceptions than respondents’ gender, was only partly supported. Our findings suggest that this is true for respondents’ prior psychological, but not physical IPV experiences and for the manipulations of the gender dynamics within the couple, but not so much for the type of violence employed. Implications of these findings are discussed. From a prevention perspective, greater insight into these perceptions is relevant as they have been shown to be related to help-seeking and reporting behavior in the case of experiencing or witnessing IPV.

               This study describes the patterns of collaboration among economic development organizations (EDOs) in eastern Kentucky. Economic development organizations work to improve the economic conditions of their respective locales. They operate in a region facing many historical barriers to economic sustainability, and where resource scarcity is the norm. Given this distressed context, a deeper understanding of how these organizations work together provides valuable insight into practices that promote or discourage goal attainment. Employing a social network perspective, we examine the patterns of collaboration between ninety-eight EDOs currently operating in the region. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with EDO leaders and via an online survey. In this paper, we review the relevant literature and our methodology, identify the population of such organizations, describe their characteristics, and illustrate the various ways in which they collaborate. Our findings reveal that although EDOs share a common mission to promote local economic development, they vary widely in their service offerings and geographic scope, and only leverage about 8 percent of their networking potential.",,,,

Initial evidence indicates that the effectiveness of accelerators varies by entrepreneurial ecosystem features, such as density and university involvement. Current scholarship is limited, however, in that it doesn't provide an adequate explanation for why that is the case. In this paper we use creative class theory to explain the distinct advantages of an accelerator powered by an urban, metropolitan, research university. Chief among these advantages are the dense and diverse networks that comprise urban research universities and the value that each network participant contributes. In addition, we posit that it is the amplification of these collective contributions that are critical to startup success and the overall vitality of the entrepreneurial ecosystem within the region.

                Background
                Teacher communities of practice, identity, and self-efficacy have been proposed to influence positive teacher outcomes in retention, suggesting all three may be related constructs. Qualitative studies of communities of practice can be difficult to empirically link to identity and self-efficacy in larger samples. In this study, we operationalized teacher communities of practice as specific networks related to teaching content and/or pedagogy. This scalable approach allowed us to quantitatively describe communities of practice and explore statistical relationships with other teacher characteristics. We asked whether these community of practice networks were related to identity and self-efficacy, similar to other conceptualizations of communities of practice.
              
                Results
                We analyzed survey data from 165 in-service K-12 teachers prepared in science or mathematics at 5 university sites across the USA. Descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analyses indicated that math teachers consistently reported smaller communities of practice and lower identity and self-efficacy scores. Correlations revealed that communities of practice are more strongly and positively related to identity than self-efficacy.
              
                Conclusion
                We demonstrate that teacher communities of practice can be described as networks. These community of practice networks are correlated with teacher identity and self-efficacy, similar to published qualitative descriptions of communities of practice. Community of practice networks are therefore a useful research tool for evaluating teacher characteristics such as discipline, identity, self-efficacy, and other possible outcomes (e.g., retention). These findings suggest that teacher educators aiming to foster strong teacher identities could develop pre-service experiences within an explicit, energizing community of practice.

                Background
                Retaining highly qualified science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers is imperative for meeting demands of the twenty-first century STEM workforce. While multiple studies have revealed several factors that influence teacher retention, little work has examined how these factors interact with one another. This study explored the relationship between two critical factors that relate to teachers’ decisions to remain in the profession: teacher identity and communities of practice (CoP) networks.
              
                Results
                Drawing upon scholarship on science teacher identity, CoP, and social network theory, we demonstrate a quantitative relationship between perceived network bridging roles and career commitment, which is mediated through teacher identity.
              
                Conclusions
                The findings from this study have both implications for scholarship in teacher retention and science teacher identity development. Potential solutions for improving novice teachers’ self-image through providing opportunities to grow their professional networks both locally and regionally/nationally are suggested.

In this article, the authors investigate one piece of the puzzle. The authors model a social cognitive approach to understanding self-efficacy, a key precursor to job performance and retention. Their interactionist approach accounts for both demographic (i.e., gender and age) and relational variables (i.e., social networks). The authors test their ideas on a sample of 159 STEM teachers across five geographic regions in the United States. Their analysis reveals patterned differences in self-efficacy across gender that are contingent on the communities of practice in which the teachers are embedded. Together, their theory and findings highlight the value of taking a holistic, interactionist view in explaining STEM teacher self-efficacy. ",,,,

This study examines how partners’ relative positions within a collaboration network impact their interdependence and collaborative success. Our analysis of 298 collaborations between 98 economic development organizations operating in an economically distressed rural region demonstrates that social network properties—structural embeddedness and relative centrality—have substantial effects on exchange partners’ collaborative success. We also investigate whether network effects are mediated by the two dimensions of interdependence, mutual dependence and power imbalance. Together, our theorizing and results speak to the driving factors of collaborative success in a context where collaboration is particularly vital. ",,,,

               An incentive exists for closely held C corporations to pay owner-employees higher salaries and lower dividends to avoid the double tax on corporate income. For this reason, the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations limit corporate compensation deductions to “reasonable compensation”; however, primary tax authorities do not provide a standard definition, leaving the courts to determine what is reasonable and what is not. The courts have generally followed two approaches: a multi-factor test and an independent investor test. We provide an in-depth exploration of reasonable compensation case law with a focus on disparity within and across court circuits. We supplement this exploration with an analysis of whether multi-factor determined court outcomes would have changed under the independent investor test. Overall, our findings show disparity in reasonable compensation court determinations within and across circuits and highlight the need for a consistent standard to create tax equity in employee-shareholder compensation practices.",,,,

Using articles from well-regarded journals to evaluate the operationalization choice of the “restatement” variable, the authors assemble a pedagogical approach that includes exercises professors can use with doctoral students.  The setting chosen explores three methods used to operationalize the financial restatement variable in empirical archival accounting literature that students can explore: announcement date, first occurrence, and all occurrences.  Students are first tasked with identifying the elements influencing measurement choice.  Next, students assess whether findings reveal that statistically distinct results arise from each of the three measurement choices evaluated.  Finally, students come to realize that an incorrect measurement choice may subject research findings to reductions in explanatory power, risk of type 1 and type 2 errors, and altered direction (sign) of coefficients.  Achieving clarity in measurement choice and exposition are challenges inherent in accounting scholarship.  This pedagogical approach helps nascent scholars work through these challenges using an actual empirical research setting, i.e., financial restatements.  The insights gained can be applied by doctoral students in their own research efforts.",cc-by,,,

However, studies suggest the tax authority acquires information in tax disclosures, creating a trade-off for managers on whether to provide decision-useful information for stakeholders or conceal information from the tax authority. We investigate this trade-off by examining the readability of tax footnotes. We find a positive association between tax avoidance and tax footnote readability for firms with tax avoidance below the industry-year median, consistent with managers highlighting good performance in the form of tax savings with straightforward disclosures. In contrast, we find a negative association between tax avoidance and tax footnote readability for firms with levels of tax avoidance above the industry-year median, consistent with managers concealing tax avoidance from the tax authority. Reinforcing these results, we find that investors place a premium (discount) on tax avoidance when the tax footnote is straightforward in firms with tax avoidance below (above) the industry-year median.",,,,

Each runner in the case is based on a real person and is presented as a separate scenario with some common concepts across the scenarios. Specific concepts included are hobby versus for-profit activity classification, independent contractor versus employee role classification, income recognition, expense deductibility, charitable contribution deductions, and athletic scholarship taxation. The modular nature of the case allows the instructor to assign specific tax issues or entire scenarios, depending on the nature of the class. As the students complete the case, they are required to use critical thinking to identify and build tax research skills to address the issues.

This increases the care burden of health care providers during times when the governmental structure may be overwhelmed or functioning in a less than optimal manner.

Disaster nursing includes the care of populations affected by disasters, public health emergencies, and mass casualty events, both natural and man-made. A unique knowledge base, abilities, and skills are needed to respond appropriately to health care and human service needs resulting from these events.MethodsDespite prior efforts to advance disaster nursing as a specialty, none were sustainable and a professional framework for establishing standards and guidelines remains lacking.ResultsDisaster nursing is a complex arena where the intersection of competence, scope of practice, regulation, and clinical guidelines continues to evolve. Professional credibility and our contribution to disaster response lie in our ability to articulate and advance professionalism. Disaster nursing as a specialty practice requires a similar foundational framework to nursing specialties recognized by the American Nurses Association within a model of professional practice in order to ensure population outcomes that are reflective of safe, quality, evidence-based practice.ConclusionsIt is time to define a disaster nursing scope of practice, establish standards for care, identify best practices, and pursue the establishment of an independent professional organization within the field of disaster nursing. This will establish the necessary foundation for optimizing nursing’s contribution to and support of the National Health Security Strategy.

These climate change-related water disasters (CCRWDs) have a devastating impact on communities and the health of residents. Clinicians and policymakers require a substantive body of evidence on which to base planning, prevention, and disaster response to these events. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature concerning the impact of CCRWDs on public health in order to identify factors in these events that are amenable to preparedness and mitigation. Ultimately, this evidence could be used by nurses to advocate for greater preparedness initiatives and inform national and international disaster policy.<h4>Design and methods</h4>A systematic literature review of publications identified through a comprehensive search of five relevant databases (PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science) was conducted using a modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach in January 2017 to describe major themes and associated factors of the impact of CCRWDs on population health.<h4>Findings</h4>Three major themes emerged: environmental disruption resulting in exposure to toxins, population susceptibility, and health systems infrastructure (failure to plan-prepare-mitigate, inadequate response, and lack of infrastructure). Direct health impact was characterized by four major categories: weather-related morbidity and mortality, waterborne diseases/water-related illness, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, and psychiatric/mental health effects. Scope and duration of the event are factors that exacerbate the impact of CCRWDs. Discussion of specific factors amenable to mitigation was limited. Flooding as an event was overrepresented in this analysis (60%), and the majority of the research reviewed was conducted in high-income or upper middle-/high-income countries (62%), despite the fact that low-income countries bear a disproportionate share of the burden on morbidity and mortality from CCRWDs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Empirical evidence related to CCRWDs is predominately descriptive in nature, characterizing the cascade of climatic shifts leading to major environmental disruption and exposure to toxins, and their resultant morbidity and mortality. There is inadequate representation of research exploring potentially modifiable factors associated with CCRWDs and their impact on population health. This review lays the foundation for a wide array of further areas of analysis to explore the negative health impacts of CCRWDs and for nurses to take a leadership role in identifying and advocating for evidence-based policies to plan, prevent, or mitigate these effects.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Nurses comprise the largest global healthcare workforce and are in a position to advocate for disaster preparedness for CCRWDs, develop more robust environmental health policies, and work towards mitigating exposure to environmental toxins that may threaten human health.",,28834176.0,"['Climate change', 'Public Health', 'Disasters', 'Humans', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Floods', 'Cyclonic Storms', 'Climate Change', 'Population Health']",

In clonal microbial populations, variation in gene regulation is often interpreted as metabolic heterogeneity. This follows the central dogma of biology, in which information flows from DNA to RNA to protein and ultimately manifests as activity. At present, DNA and RNA can be characterized in single cells, but the abundance and activity of proteins cannot. Inferences about metabolic activity usually therefore rely on the assumption that transcription reflects activity. By tracking the atoms from which they build their biomass, we make direct observations of growth rate and substrate specialization in individual cells throughout a period of growth in a changing environment.

               Understanding the evolution of novel physiological traits is highly relevant for expanding the characterization and manipulation of biological systems. Acquisition of new traits can be achieved through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Here, we investigate drivers that promote or deter the maintenance of HGT-driven degeneracy, occurring when processes accomplish identical functions through nonidentical components. Subsequent evolution can optimize newly acquired functions; for example, beneficial alleles identified in an engineered Methylorubrum extorquens strain allowed it to utilize a “Foreign” formaldehyde oxidation pathway substituted for its Native pathway for methylotrophic growth. We examined the fitness consequences of interactions between these alleles when they were combined with the Native pathway or both (Dual) pathways. Unlike the Foreign pathway context where they evolved, these alleles were often neutral or deleterious when moved into these alternative genetic backgrounds. However, there were instances where combinations of multiple alleles resulted in higher fitness outcomes than individual allelic substitutions could provide. Importantly, the genetic context accompanying these allelic substitutions significantly altered the fitness landscape, shifting local fitness peaks and restricting the set of accessible evolutionary trajectories. These findings highlight how genetic context can negatively impact the probability of maintaining native and HGT-introduced functions together, making it difficult for degeneracy to evolve. However, in cases where the cost of maintaining degeneracy was mitigated by adding evolved alleles impacting the function of these pathways, we observed rare opportunities for pathway coevolution to occur. Together, our results highlight the importance of genetic context and resulting epistasis in retaining or losing HGT-acquired degenerate functions.",cc-by-nc-4.0,,,

            Organisms frequently exchange costly resources with other species. Theory suggests that this paradoxical cooperation between species might have its origins in waste consumption. When a species benefits from the waste of another, the recipient can evolve to aid the waste producer. The waste producer could then be selected to provide costly resources in return. We previously demonstrated the first step of this theorized process:
            Salmonella enterica
            evolved to secrete a costly amino acid to increase access to a byproduct generated by
            Escherichia coli
            . Here, we provide demonstration of a waste producer switching to costly cooperation.
            E. coli
            repeatedly evolved novel secretion of sugar to feed
            S. enterica
            . The results validate long-standing theory about the evolutionary origins of costly mutualism.

To make this happen, efficient coordination mechanisms and “offloading” algorithms are needed to allow mobile devices and the edge cloud to work together smoothly. In this survey article, we investigate the key issues, methods, and various state-of-the-art efforts related to the offloading problem. We adopt a new characterizing model to study the whole process of offloading from mobile devices to the edge cloud. Through comprehensive discussions, we aim to draw an overall “big picture” on the existing efforts and research directions. Our study also indicates that the offloading algorithms in the edge cloud have demonstrated profound potentials for future technology and application development.",,,,

But researchers in other disciplines have found that reported expectations are highly susceptible to exogenous factors (e.g., anchors and question ordering), indicating that such values are somewhat arbitrary responses to probabilistic questions. At the same time, reported expectations are coherent within persons, such that respondents rank order them rationally. For deterrence, then, absolute values reported on arrest risks are likely not stable but individuals still rank order specific crimes in meaningful ways. We examine the interpretability of reported arrest risk for three possibilities: 1) Reported risks are stable probabilistic values; 2) reported risks are arbitrary and uninformative for deterrence research; or 3) reported risks display “coherent arbitrariness” with unstable values between individuals but stable rank ordering of crimes within individuals. Through the use of three random experiments of college students, our results indicate that elicited risk perceptions are arbitrary in that they are influenced by the presentation of anchors and question ordering. Nevertheless, the rank ordering of crimes within and across conditions is unaffected by the presentation of anchors, suggesting that reported risks are locally coherent within persons.",,,,

Important questions in this area remain to be explored, and this study considered a central question: Whether important across-individual variability in risk perceptions can be tied to important individual-level factors. This article extends the Bayesian risk updating model developed by Anwar and Loughran (2011) to determine whether the weight individuals place on new offending information differs across persons on the basis of individual characteristics. Using longitudinal data from a sample of serious youthful offenders, we found that the effect of an arrest on updated risk perceptions differs as a function of IQ and early behavioral problems. In particular, individuals low in verbal IQ and those who display early behavioral problems place greater weight on new information, suggesting that individuals who are traditionally viewed as being high in criminal propensity are more affected by arrest such that they are more likely to increase their perceived risk of getting caught when offending after experiencing an arrest. Findings support the idea that high-propensity offenders are more responsive to formal sanctions, and thus (potentially) more deterrable, than low-propensity individuals.",,22449003.0,"['Humans', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Risk Assessment', 'Motivation', 'Individuality', 'Intelligence', 'Punishment', 'Criminal Psychology', 'Culture', 'Juvenile Delinquency', 'Logic', 'Adolescent', 'Prisoners', 'United States', 'Female', 'Male']",

This study also offers an alternative way to document projection bias.Methods:249 public high school students completed a survey about what factors inform their perceptions of friends’ drinking behavior. Subjects also responded to several vignettes in order to assess their general tendency to engage in projection.Results:Subjects rely on both observed behavior and various forms of communication when forming perceptions of friends’ drinking, though there is notable variation across these elements. When using hypothetical vignettes, results suggest projection bias is significantly diminished as subjects are provided with more information about a hypothetical peer.Conclusions:Adolescents appear to rely on a wide range of information when forming perceptions about friends’ drinking behavior. Although we did document a tendency to engage in projection when subjects had minimal information about a peer, the fragility of this tendency questions whether perceptual measures are inherently contaminated.",,,,

As a result, traditional notions of success may limit our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to differential transitional and adaptation pathways among today's children of immigrants. This study explores the definitions of success among a sample of Bosnian-origin youth in St. Louis.<h4>Method</h4>The analysis is based on the first wave of in-depth qualitative interviews with 58 Bosnian second-generation youth (age 15-23) in St. Louis. Interviews lasted 45-90 min, were conducted in English, transcribed and coded following an inductive analytic logic.<h4>Results</h4>Overall the respondents complemented traditional notions of success, such as material stability and family formation with more subjective indicators such as self-fulfillment and happiness.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The findings highlight the importance for future waves of data collection to trace how definitions of success evolve and how they shape particular trajectories of the youth in our study. On a more general level, these findings urge researchers to incorporate definitions of success that are not primarily based on social and economic status mobility in an effort to generate a more nuanced understanding of the adaptations and transitions to adulthood of today's children of immigrants.",,32474219.0,"['Adaptation', 'Success', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Immigrant Youth', 'Transition To Adulthood', 'Humans', 'Data Collection', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Family Characteristics', 'Qualitative Research', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Missouri', 'Female', 'Male', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Emigrants and Immigrants', 'Young Adult']",

Despite the theoretical acknowledgement of the reciprocal nature of the father–child relationship, we currently know very little about the experience of being fathered, particularly of immigrant male youth. Drawing on qualitative data from a study of Mexican-origin male youth in Chicago, this article documents the respondents’ experiences of their fathers as providers, role models and authority figures. The analysis reveals however, that the respondents experienced these rather traditional father roles in different ways, ranging from extreme violence and neglect to dedication and sacrifice, which in turn, led to rejection, modification, or emulation in their own conceptions of fatherhood. The findings urge researchers to examine the long-term effects of being fathered among immigrant youth and more specifically, how the experience of being fathered leads to different or similar patterns of fathering behavior later in life.

            Objective:
            To compare cognitive rehabilitation (CR) interventions for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) with standard of care management, including psychoeducation and medical care for noncognitive symptoms.
          
          
            Setting:
            Military medical center.
          
          
            Participants:
            A total of 126 service members who received mTBI from 3 to 24 months before baseline evaluation and reported ongoing cognitive difficulties.
          
          
            Interventions:
            Randomized clinical trial with treatment outcomes assessed at baseline, 3-week, 6-week, 12-week, and 18-week follow-ups. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four 6-week treatment arms: (1) psychoeducation, (2) computer-based CR, (3) therapist-directed manualized CR, and (4) integrated therapist-directed CR combined with cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT). Treatment dosage was constant (10 h/wk) for intervention arms 2 to 4.
          
          
            Measures:
            Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT); Symptom Checklist–90 Revised (SCL-90-R); Key Behaviors Change Inventory (KBCI).
          
          
            Results:
            No differences were noted between treatment arms on demographics, injury-related characteristics, or psychiatric comorbidity apart from education, with participants assigned to the computer arm having less education. Using mixed-model analysis of variance, all 4 treatment groups showed a significant improvement over time on the 3 primary outcome measures. Treatment groups showed equivalent improvement on the PASAT. The therapist-directed CR and integrated CR treatment groups had better KBCI outcomes compared with the psychoeducation group. Improvements on primary outcome measures during treatment were maintained at follow-up with no differences among arms.
          
          
            Conclusions:
            Both therapist-directed CR and integrated CR with CBT reduced functional cognitive symptoms in service members after mTBI beyond psychoeducation and medical management alone.

Drawing on the resources provided by intentional systems theory, this article first outlines an approach to investigating humor based on the idea of a comic stance, then sketches the Dismissal Theory of Humor (DTH) that has resulted from pursuing that approach. According to the DTH, humor manifests in cases where the future-directed significance of anticipatory failures is dismissed. Mirth, on this view, is the reward people get for declining to update predictive representational schemata in ways that maximize their future-oriented value. The theory aims to provide a plausible account of the role of humor in human mental and social life, but it also aims to be empirically vulnerable, and to generate testable predictions about how the comic stance may actually be undergirded by cognitive architectures.",,,,

	  A meta-theology makes claims about the structure of theological claims: it identifies a single, fundamental claim about God, and shows how other theological claims are derivable from the fundamental claim. In his book Depicting Deity and other articles, Jon Kvanvig has identified three distinct meta-theologies: Creator Theology, Perfect Being Theology, and Worship-worthiness Theology. In this article, we argue that the medieval Islamic philosopher Avicenna's views about God have the structure of a meta-theology, and that it is distinct from the three projects Kvanvig identifies. This view is Necessary Existent Theology.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Although the program primarily meets synchronously online, the January 2020 “Wintercession” field trip to heritage sites in Montgomery, Alabama, provided an opportunity for face-to-face interactions, deep conversation, and reflection. Curricular, conversational, and collaborative inquiry deepened awareness and activated activism toward issues of racial justice. The use of high-impact practices (Kuh, 2008) allowed the cohort and faculty mentors to delve further into heritage leadership themes, including: confronting difficult emotions, recognizing sanctified space, facilitating group bonding and trust building, identifying models for activism, and moving forward in activism. We argue that the emergence of these themes demonstrates the value of immersing students and faculty in a shared, high-impact experience that focused on awareness, remembering, and wondering—the process of imagining the not yet (Keenan-Lechel et al., 2019)—as a means to “activate activism” in a cohort-based Ed.D. program.",cc-by-4.0,,,

We examined preschool children’s response to a supplemental literacy intervention ( Story Friends) in two classrooms. Children with weak vocabulary skills were identified and received the intervention. The extremes in children’s response to Story Friends ranged from highly effective to very ineffective. In one classroom, three children who were not responsive to Story Friends received additional intervention components. Two of these children acquired new vocabulary words at rates comparable to highly responsive peers receiving Story Friends only, and greater than peers in both classrooms not receiving additional support. The third child was dropped due to refusal to attend sessions. Children’s lack of learning the control words demonstrated that their progress on the taught words was not due simply to listening to the words read in the stories. ",,,,

The review considers research across grades P–12, as well as conversations in teacher education, with a specific focus on the U.S. context. Limiting the review to the U.S. context is done not to obfuscate conceptions of race and inequalities globally, but to elucidate how race becomes manifested in unique ways in the United States—often positioning African Americans and Blackness as the “fundamental other.” The review offers a social, historical, and political discussion that contextualizes how classroom conversations, and their omission, are not conversations only relegated to the classroom, but are part of a larger dialogue within the broader society.",,,,

Methods such as logistic regression or the naïve Bayes algorithm produce a score related to the likelihood that a record belongs to a particular class. A cutoff threshold is then defined to delineate the prediction of one class over another. This paper derives analytic results for the selection of an optimal cutoff threshold for a classification algorithm that is used to inform a two-action decision in the cases of risk aversion and risk neutrality. The results provide insight to how the optimal cutoff thresholds relate to the associated costs and the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for both the risk neutral and risk averse decision makers. The optimal risk averse threshold is not reliably above or below the optimal risk neutral threshold, but the relation depends on the parameters of a particular application. The results further show the risk averse optimal threshold is insensitive to the size of the data set or the magnitude of the costs, but instead is sensitive to the proportion of positive records in the data and the ratio of costs. Numeric examples and sensitivity analysis derive further insight. Results show the percent value gap from a misspecified risk attitude increases as the specificity of the classification algorithm decreases. ",,,,

The company develops a novel prediction tool based on the projects’ required software development tasks as described by firm-specific design patterns. The firm provides these predictions within a set of estimates based on industry standard function count methods as well as firm-specific predictive models based on function points and on initial labor assignments. Company management is thus equipped with predictions from multiple methodologies and multiple information sources, enhancing the firm’s ability to predict project needs. Managers aggregate the forecasts, with prediction performance estimated to improve by 35%–49%, measured relative to estimates of the absolute percentage error of the prior method. The improved predictions provide a significant advantage to planning decisions and efficient internal operations. Insights to how managers aggregate the set of forecasts and insights to how the models contribute to the scaled value of information are discussed and further illustrate the benefits of the approach.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to describe the current state of the science of the misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder, with the ultimate goal of improving psychiatric diagnostic workups including screening. DESIGN: An integrative review was conducted using standard criteria for evaluating research articles. RESULTS: Forty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Articles explored patient-related and health care provider-related factors contributing to the misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder as well as consequences of misdiagnosis. Clinically oriented, reliable, and valid screening tools for bipolar disorder also were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of multiple, challenging patient-related factors and more comprehensive assessment and screening by health care providers may reduce misdiagnosis. ",,,,

Thirteen interviews and 15 surveys were analyzed, all of which met the following criteria: (1) self-reported chronic pain (persistent pain lasting a minimum of six months), (2) current use of prescription opioid medications, (3) pain not successfully controlled.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis revealed a paradox, which we describe as being lost/finding myself in the health care system. This paradox became the overarching pattern of experience that subsumed several dynamic, overlapping practices described in the patterns: (1) seeking relief as suffering; (2) being classified as an addict but not an addict; (3) living with pain as remembering; and (4) experiencing treatment modalities as fickle possibilities.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Explication of and interpretive commentary on these patterns shift the focus from drug seeking to pain relief seeking behaviors in chronic pain sufferers.

Building on current methodological literature in qualitative research regarding in-depth email interviewing, we move the conversation toward elicitation of quality data and management of multiple concurrent email interviews. Excerpts are shared from a field journal that was kept throughout one study, with commentary on developing insights. Valuable lessons learned include the importance of (a) logistics and timing related to the management of multiple concurrent email interviews, (b) language and eliciting the data, (c) constructing the email, and (d) processing text-based data and preparing transcripts. Qualitative researchers seeking deeply reflective answers and geographically diverse samples may wish to consider using in-depth email interviews. ",,,,

Thirty adults 60 years of age with (a) at least three chronic medical diagnoses, (b) at least five medications at baseline, and (c) a new medication prescription were enrolled in a prospective study of 30 days duration, participating from their homes.<h4>Methods</h4>In-depth hermeneutic interviews (2 per 15 participants) and self-assessment diaries recorded on electronic tablets (daily per 30 participants) were completed. Transcribed interviews and self-recorded survey data were analyzed using hermeneutical analysis and ecological momentary assessment and content analysis, respectively.<h4>Findings</h4>Common reasons participants did not take medications as prescribed included tolerability, transportation, access to medications, and forgetting. The overarching pattern, ""preserving self,"" was supported by two patterns that subsumed several themes: (a) engaging the powerful hold of my illness, and (b) engaging providers in visioning health.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A deeper understanding of the impact of receiving a new prescription and of managing medication reveals the challenges patients experience in preserving a sense of self. Healthcare providers of all disciplines should understand the meaning of medication prescribing and medication taking to ameliorate medication-taking difficulties.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>The provider-patient relationship is often cited as an area that needs to be addressed in healthcare practice.

Data were categorized using comparative analysis, theoretical sampling, and coding techniques.<h4>Findings</h4>The three phases-(a) visiting my perception, (b) weighing the evidence, and (c) making a new meaning-explained the core process of the grounded theory of Re-Forming the Risk Message.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Rural low-income families at risk for environmental hazards in their homes determined what health information and needed subsequent actions regarding their risks were important by changing the meanings of nurse-delivered messages.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Nursing interventions designed to improve health behaviors and reduce risks are often based on stage theories that explain how change occurs through steps leading to positive actions through delivery of risk messages. However, the risk message delivered in an intervention designed to engage action is not always the risk message people decide to use. To understand whether people are ready to engage in positive behaviors through interventions, or if needed changes to the information must be made, nurses need to discover and explore reasons for the re-formed risk messages.",,26076588.0,"['Rural', 'Environmental Health', 'Public Health Nursing', 'Grounded Theory', 'Risk Messages', 'Humans', 'Attitude to Health', 'Community Health Nursing', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Health Education', 'Adult', 'Middle Aged', 'Rural Population', 'Preventive Health Services', 'United States', 'Female', 'Male', 'Consumer Health Information', 'Young Adult']",

          Adolescent substance use (SU) endures as a priority concern to communities. The increasing risk of SU in young women has been a rising concern, and the needs of young women may be unique. The importance of relationships and “connectedness” as aberrant behavior protective factors has been validated extensively in the literature of several disciplines over the past decade. Less well described are the components and qualities of relational engagement among adolescents involved in SU treatment. This multimethod study was a broad analysis of the nature of relational health in adolescent girls, so as to determine whether understanding components of relational health could inform SU treatment options. The survey tool, the Relational Health Indices (Liang et al., 2002), was used to measure dimensions and domains of relational health in adolescent girls and informed qualitative methods in the study. It is clear from this research that adolescent girls in SU treatment care deeply about but are confused regarding their relationships with others, particularly their romantic partners and their mothers. They have a desire to help others, specifically their siblings and others struggling with addiction. This article describes the multimethod study and implications for treatment, research, and education.",,,,

Current diabetes self-management recommendations, targeting Mexican Americans in particular, remain largely broad (""reduce your calorie intake"" or ""cut back on carbs""), overly ambitious (""stop eating tortillas""), and relatively ineffective (Svedbo Engström et al., BMJ Open 6(3):e010249, 2016; Johansson et al., Int J Qual Stud Health Well-being 11, 2016; Oomen et al., The Diabetes Educ 25:220-225, 1999; Franek, Ont Health Technol Assess Ser 13(9):1-60, 2013; Purnell et al. Patient 9:349, 2016).<h4>Methods</h4>A secondary and focused analysis (<i>N</i> = 12) was performed on data gathered from a larger qualitative study (<i>N</i> = 16), which explored diabetes among Mexican-American women residing in rural South Texas.<h4>Results</h4>Findings from the secondary analysis were that study informants elicited more realistic or contextually relevant, specific self-management strategies that reflected the cognitive, emotive, and behavioral areas but were reframed within the context of the Mexican-American culture. Self-management strategies fell into the categories of: (a) environmental controls, (b) avoiding overeating, (c) lifestyle changes, (d) cooking tips, and (e) active self-management.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Diabetes remains a serious health threat to Mexican Americans, women in particular. Few individuals attain glycemic control, likely due in part to the disconnect between global and non-contextual self-management recommendations offered by health care providers and the need for more detailed and realistic guidance required for the day-to-day self-management of diabetes.",cc-by,28694738.0,"['Culture', 'Diabetes', 'Self-management', 'Hispanic', 'Contextual Reality']",PMC5500922

Methods Transcripts (n = 10) from semi-structured interviews were analyzed using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to more deeply explore the accounts of DEs’ goal setting with patients with type 2 diabetes. Results The overarching pattern that emerged was “Striking a Balance,” which subsumed 4 subthemes: Applying Theoretical-Practical Principles When Setting Goals, Identifying Idealistic-Realistic Expectations, Creating Patient-Educator–Centered Plans, and Readying-Living With Goal Setting. The pattern, “Striking a Balance,” revealed a common meaning of DEs as experiences requiring balance and nuance in goal setting with patients. Implications The results of this study combined with the tenets of the self-determination theory can provide the DEs with real-life exemplars and a theoretical framework to encourage their patients to self-manage, increase intrinsic motivation, and improve adherence related to their lifestyle changes and glycemic control. DEs, as facilitators of change, can implement these changes with flexible and reciprocal activities with their patients. The DEs owned these activities and they are: “building the bond,” “sharing the session,” “readying for change,” “sending them home,” and “bringing them back.” ",,,,

Thirty adults 60 years of age with (a) at least three chronic medical diagnoses, (b) at least five medications at baseline, and (c) a new medication prescription were enrolled in a prospective study of 30 days duration, participating from their homes.<h4>Methods</h4>In-depth hermeneutic interviews (2 per 15 participants) and self-assessment diaries recorded on electronic tablets (daily per 30 participants) were completed. Transcribed interviews and self-recorded survey data were analyzed using hermeneutical analysis and ecological momentary assessment and content analysis, respectively.<h4>Findings</h4>Common reasons participants did not take medications as prescribed included tolerability, transportation, access to medications, and forgetting. The overarching pattern, ""preserving self,"" was supported by two patterns that subsumed several themes: (a) engaging the powerful hold of my illness, and (b) engaging providers in visioning health.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A deeper understanding of the impact of receiving a new prescription and of managing medication reveals the challenges patients experience in preserving a sense of self. Healthcare providers of all disciplines should understand the meaning of medication prescribing and medication taking to ameliorate medication-taking difficulties.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>The provider-patient relationship is often cited as an area that needs to be addressed in healthcare practice.

This study describes a sample of women with histories of arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) who were interviewed outside a criminal justice setting and contrasts women with single versus multiple DUI convictions.MethodsWomen with recent documented histories of DUI participated in a study of women's health behaviors. Thirty‐six women with 1 DUI and 62 with 2 or more DUIs participated in a diagnostic telephone interview which assessed demographics, alcohol use and problems, psychiatric problems, treatment, and partner violence.ResultsThe sample overall had high rates of co‐occurring psychiatric problems, parental alcohol problems, early sexual and physical abuse, and head injuries. Alcohol use severity and the prevalence of head injuries and partner alcohol problems were significantly higher among women with multiple DUIs than women with a single DUI. Measures reflecting life context, such as marital status, number of children, and childhood trauma, were not associated with number of DUIs.ConclusionsFindings suggest that DUI recidivism in women is accounted for primarily by AUD severity and is not influenced by previous life events such as partner violence, psychiatric problems, and family context such as divorce/separation or number of children. Multiple DUIs in women may mark an alcohol severity threshold beyond which few factors account for additional risk.",,,,

            Background:
            The purpose of this pilot study was to develop and implement a Web-based, e-Visit simulation experience for nurse practitioner students and evaluate student satisfaction and perceived learning.
          
          
            Method:
            
              The convenience sample consisted of 26 senior-level Master of Science in Nursing students in the Pediatric Nurse Practitioner and Adult-Gerontology Nurse Practitioner programs. A Likert survey was used for evaluation that measured items from 1 (
              strongly disagree
              ) to 5 (
              strongly agree
              ).
            
          
          
            Results:
            
              Students reported that the simulation cases closely resembled real-world patients (97%;
              M
              = 4.42,
              SD
              = 0.69), providing them with a better understanding of complaints commonly addressed via telehealth services (96%;
              M
              = 4.46,
              SD
              = 0.57). Accuracy of diagnosis and treatment on first attempt was 95%.
            
          
          
            Conclusion:
            
              A Web-based, e-Visit simulation can be a useful learning experience for nurse practitioner students with knowledge gained that is transferable to real clinical situations. [

This study develops a Latent Class Analysis model to determine whether there are categories of women who endorsed some type of violence but not others.

FH of alcohol dependence and trauma has been separately shown to adversely affect planning/problem-solving aspects of executive function. However, few studies have examined these risk factors in an integrated model.<h4>Methods</h4>Using data from trauma-exposed individuals from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism prospective cohort (N = 1,860), comprising offspring from alcohol-dependent high-risk and comparison families (mean age [SE] = 21.9 [4.2]), we investigated associations of trauma (nonsexual assaultive, nonassaultive, sexual assaultive) with DSM-IV PTSD and alcohol dependence symptom counts, and planning/problem-solving abilities assessed using the Tower of London Test (TOLT). Moderating effects of family history density of alcohol use disorder (FHD) on these associations and sex differences were explored.<h4>Results</h4>Family history density was positively associated with PTSD in female participants who endorsed a sexual assaultive trauma. Exposure to nonsexual assaultive trauma was associated with more excess moves made on the TOLT.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Findings from this study demonstrate associations with PTSD and alcohol dependence symptom counts, as well as poor problem-solving ability in trauma-exposed individuals from families densely affected with alcohol dependence, depending on trauma type, FHD, and sex. This suggests that having a FH of alcohol dependence and exposure to trauma during adolescence may be associated with more PTSD and alcohol dependence symptoms, and poor problem-solving abilities in adulthood.",cc-by,32990406.0,"['Trauma', 'alcoholism', 'Post-traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Executive Function', 'Humans', 'Alcoholism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Prospective Studies', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Male', 'Young Adult']",PMC7667345

A multipronged, mixed-methods approach was used to identify essential education needs and required core competencies. Data were synthesized from discussion with key informants, review of relevant documents, and surveys of schools of nursing, public health, and medicine. The ADDIE model was used to integrate results into the development of the online learning tool kits using the ThingLink software program. An innovative online educational program to prepare healthcare providers to rapidly identify, mitigate, and manage the impact of the Zika and Flint Water crises upon pregnant women and children was implemented by the Society for the Advancement of Disaster Nursing.

However, exposure to the juvenile justice system can be a traumatic event that results in further delinquency—highlighting a need to develop community-based interventions to prevent delinquency. Collective efficacy theory is a commonly used framework to prevent juvenile delinquency. Although community-level interventions have been developed based on collective efficacy, research suggests that they are limited in their effectiveness. This may be due to limitations in our conceptualisation of collective efficacy, and our limited understanding of how perceptions of collective efficacy differ between youths and parents. The present study utilises data from the Fragile Families Child Wellbeing Study to test parent and youth perceptions of collective efficacy as predictors of self-reported juvenile delinquency. The results indicate that—although collective efficacy is typically associated with lower levels of juvenile delinquency in neighbourhoods—neither parents’ nor youths’ perceptions of collective efficacy are strong predictors of self-reported juvenile delinquency. The findings suggest that focusing on youth, family and neighbourhood characteristics may maximise the effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing juvenile delinquency.",,,,

In sociology, collective efficacy is the process by which social cohesion is activated as informal social control. In psychology, collective efficacy is a construct that focuses on a group's belief in its ability to achieve shared goals. Mutual efficacy reflects group members' beliefs that collective action can be successful at achieving group goals. Mutual efficacy was developed as a bridge between the sociological and psychological conceptualizations of collective efficacy. Prior research supports mutual efficacy as a mediator of the relationship between social cohesion and informal social control. However, little is known about the individual and neighborhood‐level characteristics that predict mutual efficacy.MethodsThis study tests predictors of mutual efficacy using regression while accounting for clustering at the neighborhood level through the use of Huber–White sandwich estimators.ResultsFindings show that multiple factors influence mutual efficacy including social cohesion, resident mobility, income, and education.ConclusionFindings highlight the importance of building mutual efficacy through facilitating interactions among neighbors, increasing access to education, and fostering economic stability.",,,,

               Empowerment refers to the ways in which individuals and groups gain greater control over their lives. To date, the majority of studies focus on empowerment at the individual level. Further, research typically focuses on how to make people feel empowered and not how communities exercise their power. The present study utilizes collective efficacy, a community-level theory, to explore community characteristics that may empower individuals to engage in household activism, and communities to participate in neighborhood activism. The findings suggest that mutual efficacy and social cohesion are key drivers of participation in both household and neighborhood activism. Self-efficacy is associated with household activism only. Findings suggest that it is important to use individual-level skill-building opportunities as a method for fostering a collective identity and train community members to recruit others. In addition, community-building initiatives are more likely to result in activism if they focus on building mutual efficacy in the community.",,,,

However, research highlights a critical disparity in firearm-related deaths by race. Researchers often cite racial bias as a contributing factor for the racial disparity in firearm-related deaths. To provide a foundation for potential social work interventions, the present article discusses the results of an assessment of whether explicit racial biases toward four racial and ethnic groups (white, black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino), fear of crime, and the quantity and quality of interactions with neighbors of a different race are predictors of gun ownership. Findings suggest that explicit racial bias toward black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino individuals is a significant predictor of gun ownership. Fear of crime and more frequent interactions with neighbors of a different race are also significant predictors of gun ownership. Taken as a whole, findings suggest that gun owners are more likely to be more vigilant toward people of color because of stereotypical assumptions that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be involved with crime. Social work practice and policy implications include developing interventions aimed at reducing implicit bias and identifying policies that are associated with lower levels of implicit bias among gun owners.",,,,

            Objective
            Nurses' voluntary reporting of adverse events and errors is critical for improving patient safety. The operationalization and application of the concept, patient safety culture, warrant further study. The objectives are to explore the underlying factor structure, the correlational relationship, between items of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture and examine its construct validity.
          
          
            Methods
            Exploratory factor analysis was conducted using secondary data from the instrument’s database. Using pattern matching, factors obtained through exploratory factor analysis were compared with the 6-component Patient Safety Culture Theoretical Framework: degree of psychological safety, degree of organizational culture, quality of culture of safety, degree of high reliability organization, degree of deference to expertise, and extent of resilience.
          
          
            Results
            6 exploratory factors, explaining 51% of the total variance, were communication lead/speak out/resilience, organizational culture and culture of safety–environment, psychological safety–security/protection, psychological safety-support/trust, patient safety, communication, and reporting for patient safety. All factors had moderate to very strong associations (range, 0.354–0.924). Overall, construct validity was good, but few exploratory factors matched the theoretical components of degree of deference to expertise and extent of resilience.
          
          
            Conclusions

A wide variety of psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been studied in nurses globally, but many are not studied or understudied in US nurses. Theoretical underpinnings of the current study are based on the disaster component of the Middle-Range Theory of Nurses' Psychological Trauma. Objective To explore the associations of psychological responses (life satisfaction, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptomatology, attitude toward life, and compassion satisfaction), years of experience, and general health in US nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic using network analysis. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from October to November 2020 in US nurses. Network analysis was used to model the data and analyze the centrality indices of betweenness, closeness, and strength. Data were reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Results In 128 nurses, 19.35% of nurses had probable PTSD. Network analysis showed strong significant correlations between life satisfaction and perceived stress (negative), between perceived stress and PTSD symptomatology (positive), and between attitude toward life and compassion satisfaction (positive). Conclusion Low life satisfaction, high perceived stress, and low attitude toward life are key inflection points that signal the need for psychological intervention in the US nursing workforce during the continued pandemic. Based on 2021 Tri-Council of Nursing COVID-19 Report and the 2022 International Council of Nurses guideline, healthcare should implement scalable, system-level interventions to reduce psychological burden during the pandemic. The current study suggests targets for such intervention, which may promote a healthier, more effective US nursing workforce. ",cc-by-nc-4.0,,,

            Objective
            Nurses' voluntary reporting of adverse events and errors is critical for improving patient safety. The operationalization and application of the concept, patient safety culture, warrant further study. The objectives are to explore the underlying factor structure, the correlational relationship, between items of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture and examine its construct validity.
          
          
            Methods
            Exploratory factor analysis was conducted using secondary data from the instrument’s database. Using pattern matching, factors obtained through exploratory factor analysis were compared with the 6-component Patient Safety Culture Theoretical Framework: degree of psychological safety, degree of organizational culture, quality of culture of safety, degree of high reliability organization, degree of deference to expertise, and extent of resilience.
          
          
            Results
            6 exploratory factors, explaining 51% of the total variance, were communication lead/speak out/resilience, organizational culture and culture of safety–environment, psychological safety–security/protection, psychological safety-support/trust, patient safety, communication, and reporting for patient safety. All factors had moderate to very strong associations (range, 0.354–0.924). Overall, construct validity was good, but few exploratory factors matched the theoretical components of degree of deference to expertise and extent of resilience.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Factors essential to creating an environment of transparent, voluntary error reporting are proposed. Items are needed, specifically focusing on deference to expertise, the ability of the person with the most experience to speak up and lead, despite hierarchy or traditional roles, and resilience, which is coping and moving forward after adversity or mistakes.

Of these tools, accelerators have proliferated in number and variety over the past couple decades. However, growing evidence suggests that these programs are not equally effective, varying in form and function with disparate outcomes. Initial evidence indicates that the effectiveness of accelerators varies by entrepreneurial ecosystem features, such as density and university involvement. Current scholarship is limited, however, in that it doesn't provide an adequate explanation for why that is the case. In this paper we use creative class theory to explain the distinct advantages of an accelerator powered by an urban, metropolitan, research university. Chief among these advantages are the dense and diverse networks that comprise urban research universities and the value that each network participant contributes. In addition, we posit that it is the amplification of these collective contributions that are critical to startup success and the overall vitality of the entrepreneurial ecosystem within the region. We support our logic by profiling the best practices, design features, and lessons learned of an accelerator powered by a public, urban, research university serving as an anchor institution for the St. Louis region.",cc-by-4.0,,,

                  Background
                  Despite major efforts to address psychological distress and quality of life (QOL) in people with cancer, only none to small intervention effect has been observed. There is reason to question whether psychosocial needs of patients have already been met under the usual oncology care.
               
               
                  Purpose
                  The purpose of this systematic review was to examine changes in depression, anxiety and QOL during the existential plight in advanced cancer.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A literature search was performed in the PubMed and APA PsycINFO databases from year 1976 up to May 31, 2021. Longitudinal observational or experimental research targeting depression, anxiety or QOL in advanced cancer (stage III or IV), with baseline time since cancer diagnosis within 100 days, follow-up within 16 weeks post-baseline were eligible. Quality rating was based on the GRADE guidelines.
               
               
                  Results
                  Overall QOL did not reveal clinically relevant changes for the majority of studies as evaluated by effect size and raw score changes (median effect size 0.01, interquartile range −0.10–0.15). Nonetheless, modest to moderate improvement was found for depression (median effect size 0.28, interquartile range 0.03–0.38) and anxiety (median effect size 0.57, interquartile range 0.32–0.79).
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  Transient distress symptoms and temporarily reduced functioning in the oncology setting may be considered normal, whereas impaired overall QOL needs to be addressed. Developing innovative interventions that enhance QOL for patients newly diagnosed with advanced cancer without interfering with patients’ natural adaptation process is imperative.

To avoid double taxation, it permits tax cross-crediting. Through this strategy, global firms can use excess foreign tax credits (FTCs), the portion of foreign tax payments that exceed their home country tax liabilities, generated from a subsidiary located in a high-tax country to offset the tax liabilities of their low-tax divisions. This paper studies manufacturing capacity decisions in the subsidiary of an MNF with tax cross-crediting. Casting the problem on a newsvendor model, and assuming the objective of maximizing the global firm’s worldwide after-tax profits, we show that the optimal capacity decision under the effects of tax cross-crediting can behave very differently from that of the traditional newsvendor model. In particular, we show that an improvement in the firm’s after-tax profitability (through tax cross-crediting, an increased profit margin, or a reduced tax rate) might reduce the optimal capacity and that the optimal capacity decision under certain circumstances can be made without the knowledge of the demand distribution. We also discuss the issue of motivating the division manager to use an after-tax performance measure with a managerial tax rate. ",,,,

Through a dynamic inventory model that explicitly captures a firm's periodic decisions on inventory replenishment quantity, the amount of dividends net of capital subscriptions, and the amount of short‐term debt, we demonstrate that under coordinated short‐term operational and financial decisions, the firm's optimal inventory level increases initially as its long‐term debt rises; after the firm depletes its short‐term borrowing capacity, as the long‐term debt rises further, the inventory level decreases and then remains constant. In addition, we find that optimal coordinated decisions, in comparison with decentralized ones, yield lower inventories, require less cash, take larger short‐term loans, incur a lower probability of financial distress, and yield higher expected dividends net of capital subscriptions. Moreover, long‐ and short‐term debts are substitutes; an optimally leveraged firm needs less long‐term debt if it coordinates its short‐term decisions than if it decentralizes them.",,,,
Capital Structure and Supply Chain Capacity Investment,2022.0,"[{'given': 'Qiaohai (Joice)', 'family': 'Hu', 'name': 'Qiaohai (Joice) Hu'}]",Production and Operations Management,10.1111/poms.13718,journal-article,"['1059-1478', '1937-5956']",Production &amp; Oper Manag,Production &amp; Oper Manag,Wiley,7,31.0,2822-2837,2022-07-01,"['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","AbstractThis paper studies whether risky borrowing will induce a supplier to expand capacity and thus mitigate a capacity underinvestment problem in supply chains. It demonstrates that the relationship between capacity and capital structure is not as simple as the existing literature suggests. If the supplier is very powerful, it will use a mixed capital structure and build less capacity than if it were equity financed. If the buyer is very powerful, the supplier will use all debt financing and overbuild capacity. In this case, the supplier would not agree to build capacity ex ante if it were prohibited from borrowing. Hence, borrowing is Pareto optimal. Under a more balanced power structure, the supplier may choose all debt financing and overbuild capacity or all equity financing and underbuild capacity, depending on the trade‐off of the bargaining benefits and costs of debt financing.",,,,

Previous literature on religious dissent has largely focused on church members advocating change or apostatizing, solutions largely unavailable to initiates. Based on six months of ethnographic observations in a Catholic conversion class and 21 in‐depth interviews with converts, sponsors, and teachers, I demonstrate how microinteractional norms encourage an atmosphere of silence around disagreement. I then show how initiates explain this conflict avoidant response by justifying their doubt, engaging in a process of hierarchical deference, in which initiates call upon the top‐down structure of the Catholic Church to defer control upward, and faulting human imperfection rather than the institution itself. While “culture wars” debates of the past two decades have investigated a purported moral polarization of the American public, this study contributes to a growing literature on how the moderate majority negotiates disagreements between their beliefs and religious teachings.",,,,

Several recurrent motifs are shared between these women and the figurines, including the use of Bes-images, Nilotic elements, and points at the neck. These themes also appear in previously published tattooed figurines, so-called cosmetic spoons, and paintings. In some cases, the figurines and the women even share the same location of the tattoos on their body, suggesting that the combined location and tattoo motifs are integral to their function and/or meaning. Through linking tattooing on human remains with figurines, our work evaluates when we can interpret markings on figurines as tattooing while also exploring potential explanations for the tattoo motifs. To do so, we connect these new examples with texts and material culture that would have been accessible to the people of Deir el-Medina. ",,,,

Based on interviews with mothers who are users and dealers, this study analyzes four predominant maternal identities: grieving mothers, detached mothers, motherly dealers, and working mothers. Particularly relevant factors explaining variations in maternal identities include the timing of pregnancy, time spent with children, control over drug use, and place in the drug market hierarchy. By revealing patterns of intra-group variations by gender performances and work situation, the study expands upon previous work on how mothers who are structurally disadvantaged negotiate motherhood ideals.

The findings suggest that different gender performances among dealers are rooted in variations in the cultural tool kits they have at their disposal. I find that the content of women's cultural tool kits varied with three sociodemographic factors: 1) age, 2) time of entrée to the drug economy, and 3) educational and employment history. Combined, these influenced the type of gender performances the dealers tended to use as well as their position in the drug market hierarchy. The research suggests that those dealers using cultural repertoires flexibly are the most successful as they skillfully employed the model best suited for the context they were in.",,,,

The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that favor successful and sustainable SKU rationalization.Design/methodology/approachA single case study was used to investigate the implementation of an SKU rationalization project by a national restaurant chain in collaboration with its food distributor. Qualitative data analysis techniques were used to understand managers’ perceptions about the SKU rationalization problem and the financial results that were achieved.FindingsThe findings include seven propositions that begin to formalize theory for SKU rationalization. Cross-functional involvement was both a challenge and a critical success factor, and the supplier was an important resource for managing product variety and complexity.Research limitations/implicationsSeven propositions are provided that increase the likelihood of successfully dealing with SKU proliferation.Practical implicationsSKU proliferation increases supply chain complexity and leads to higher costs. The research reports on an SKU rationalization project that saved a company and its supplier $6.7m.Originality/valueA previously unexplored theoretical perspective on SKU rationalization was employed that emphasizes cross-functional alignment, buyer–supplier relationships and the impact on financial performance of a firm.",,,,

Executives in manufacturing firms have benefited from frameworks created to implement SCM processes, but this is not the case for their counterparts in service companies. The two most cited SCM frameworks for services have methodological and conceptual deficiencies. Drawing upon the service‐dominant logic of marketing and using an empirical research approach, we developed supply chain structure maps for nine service firms. Our findings indicate that the supply chain structure maps of service companies are comparable to those in the product‐based literature, which supports the service‐dominant logic. Then, we identified the six key processes that constitute a framework to manage service supply chains. The customer relationship management and the supplier relationship management processes form the critical links in the supply chain, and the other four processes are coordinated through this linkage. The SCM framework for services provides direction for executives in service firms who need to increase cross‐functional integration within their firms and with other members of the supply chain. For academics, 12 avenues for future research are identified.",,,,

The principles of contingency theory and strategic fit were not used for managing relationships.Research limitations/implicationsContingency theory combined with the relationship view suggests that management components should not be implemented at the same level for all relationships, but in the 31 relationships studied different partnership types were not managed based on their potential.Practical implicationsThe research reinforces the need for a formal structure like the Partnership Model to establish joint goals for a relationship and guide management in implementation.Originality/valueEffective supply chain management depends on the ability of managers to differentiate among partnership types and fit relational mechanisms that are appropriate. However, researchers tend to generalize their findings to all partnerships regardless of potential. The authors found support for the Partnership Model published in IJLM in 1996 as a method to resource different types of partnerships following the contingency perspective and strategic fit theory.",,,,

However, distribution of the resources needed to learn new literacies is unequal. The authors describe a qualitative case study conducted with teachers in Kenya who participated in a professional development series on new literacies and inquiry. The professional development involved an inquiry‐based literacy approach that is technology‐rich and learner‐centered. Three themes emerged from the data: shifting to learner‐centered pedagogies: “I’m inspired to improve my teaching”; change is slow but coming: “We need to be empowered with more information about new technologies”; and strategies for teaching new literacies: “Creating is better than just talking.” The discussion focuses on the enduring challenges for educational transformation in Kenya coupled with the substantive changes that are being made by pioneering Kenyan educators.",,,,

The purpose of this case study was to explore preservice English teachers’ reading identities and their perceptions of reading identity development in the context of English classrooms.Design/methodology/approachThis study used qualitative collective case design. Data sources included analogy exercise about participants’ reading identities, participant-generated observations of reading identity instruction, questionnaire on reading identity, class discussions about reading identity and final written reflection.FindingsData showed examples of participants’ reading identities as taking a variety of forms, but when discussing what shaped their reading identities, the strongest codes related to positive interactions with people and texts. The data showed that participants related positive reading identities to both reading to learn and reading for pleasure. More participants’ perceived their professional identity as that of a literature teacher than a reading teacher.Research limitations/implicationsFuture research is needed on how to support preservice teachers’ positive reading identities in English education courses.Practical implicationsOur data suggest that learning about reading identity may help preservice English teachers think of reading as something that is developing in themselves as well as their students over a lifetime. By providing space in English methods programs to attend to preservice teachers’ reading lives, we can help them rekindle or find their love of reading.Originality/valueThis research is needed because helping preservice teachers construct and enact positive reading identities in turn aids guidance of their future students’ reading identities, and having a positive reading identity is in turn linked to positive student outcomes.",,,,

Data revealed two shared areas between feminist pedagogy and ELA CCSS: (a) value of critical thinking; and (b) teachers’ and students’ power to make decisions about class content. However, three points of differences also became clear: (a) view of literacy as classified; (b) lack of women’s voices; and (c) hierarchy of academic writing styles. Implications for practice require teachers to use a dialogic rather than a monologic framework for writing instruction. ",,,,

Speaker 2: Bighorn sheep). To foster the development of advanced language, Sundberg and Sundberg (2011) proposed prerequisite skills that may engender the emergence of novel, convergent intraverbals. We used a multiple‐probe design with both nonconcurrent (across participants) and concurrent (across stimulus sets) components to evaluate the effects of training these prerequisite skills on the emergence of convergent intraverbals with four children with autism. Participants showed the emergence of convergent intraverbals at mastery levels after they displayed mastery performance on all of the prerequisite skills identified by Sundberg and Sundberg, lending support to their characterization as prerequisites. We discuss these findings in terms of operant mechanisms that may facilitate the development of generative language.",,,,

Inicialmente apresentamos três teóricos dos estudos decoloniais: Mignolo (2018), Quijano (2005) e Sousa Santos (2007). Discutimos como suas ideias nos fazem repensar o trabalho do professor de línguas, ressignificando suas práticas e propondo uma educação menos eurocêntrica, mais próxima das realidades locais. Enfatizamos a importância da desconstrução de mitos socialmente construídos sobre língua, com base em Makoni e Pennycook (2007) e, por fim, explicamos como Paulo Freire contribui para essa linha de pensamento, reforçando o discurso dos teóricos decoloniais. Concluímos o artigo, fazendo uma breve síntese do que foi discutido e propondo uma formação de professores que não se limite ao ensino das línguas em si, mas que se abra para uma discussão maior sobre o que é ser professor de línguas na atualidade.",cc-by-4.0,,,

               Amidst decades of attention directed toward improving employment outcomes for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), few efforts have been made to engage communities in identifying local solutions for expanding integrated employment opportunities. We examined the implementation and outcomes of “community conversation” events held in 6 geographically and economically diverse locales. Each event used an asset-based dialogue approach called the World Café (Brown &amp; Isaacs, 2005) to solicit ideas from a broad cross-section of community members on improving integrated employment that reflect local priorities and possibilities. Six key themes encapsulated the 1,556 strategies generated by the almost 400 attendees. Although considerable consistency was found among the categories of strategies raised across events, the manner in which those individual strategies would be implemented locally reflected the unique accent of each community. Attendees also viewed these events as promising and productive pathways for identifying next steps for their community. We offer recommendations for community-level intervention efforts and suggest directions for future research.",,,,

Quantitative analyses indicated that larger networks were associated with working at the high school level, supporting students with moderate/severe disabilities, increased years of experience, and greater knowledge about establishing collaborative partnerships. Interview analyses provided context for the quantitative results.

Previous slice provisioning methods have only considered network resource attributes and ignored network topology attributes. These methods may result in a decrease in the slice acceptance ratio and the slice provisioning revenue. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage heuristic slice provisioning algorithm, called RT-CSP, for the 5G core network by jointly considering network resource attributes and topology attributes in this paper. The first stage of our method is called the slice node provisioning stage, in which we propose an approach to scoring and ranking nodes using network resource attributes (i.e., CPU capacity and bandwidth) and topology attributes (i.e., degree centrality and closeness centrality). Slice nodes are then provisioned according to the node ranking results. In the second stage, called the slice link provisioning stage, the k-shortest path algorithm is implemented to provision slice links. To further improve the performance of RT-CSP, we propose RT-CSP+, which uses our designed strategy, called minMaxBWUtilHops, to select the best physical path to host the slice link. The strategy minimizes the product of the maximum link bandwidth utilization of the candidate physical path and the number of hops in it to avoid creating bottlenecks in the physical path and reduce the bandwidth cost. Using extensive simulations, we compared our results with those of the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Many researchers and educators argue the construct is too vague and contradictory to be useful for educators. Nevertheless, attention to dyslexia in policy and practice has increased at a rapid rate; 37 states now have dyslexia laws, and national legislation was passed in 2016. Employing Bakhtin’s concept of authoritative discourse (AD) as a theoretical lens, we examined the emergence and current state of dyslexia legislation and policy in Texas, Indiana, and Florida, three states that represent various histories of legislation and stages of policy implementation. Our analysis found similarities among the states’ legislation, particularly regarding how the policies emerged and the AD embedded within them. The International Dyslexia Society’s recommendations for a specific intervention approach that is “multisensory, systematic, and structured” appear in each state’s laws. This approach is not well supported by research, but it is officially sanctioned through legislation in many states and has had a profound effect on policy and practice. By not engaging in the discourse or using the word “dyslexia,” literacy researchers and educators place themselves outside of a closed discourse circle that influences policy and practice and deeply affects students. We encourage active participation in the conversation and in policy decisions that are currently taking place without the input of literacy educators and researchers. ",,,,

Using thematic analysis across four different data sources, we identified three main themes that peer mentors discussed based on their experiences in the program: (a) mentors’ personal development: constructing meaning of self, (b) mentee growth: perceived work and social impact, and (c) campus community benefits: normalizing disability. Peer mentors reported their own attitudes toward individuals with IDD were changed based on participating in the peer mentoring program and they observed improvements in their mentees’ personal and work-related social relationships. We discuss how these outcomes have impacted the peer mentors’ attitudes, career choices, and lives in general. We also provide implications for future research and practice regarding development and implementation of peer mentoring programs in the community.",,,,

The article focuses on Beasts of the Southern Wild, which is an allegory of Hurricane Katrina, and its black death-birthing narrative— Beasts calls upon a black girl to produce an imagined future grounded in the reproduction of a structure hostile to black life. By positing her as harbinger of a more sustainable ecological future, Beasts’ black death-birthing narrative queers Hushpuppy, a 6-year old living in intense poverty. This article focuses on Beasts to explore the relationship among the watery deaths and depths of Hurricane Katrina, refugee policies, and transatlantic slavery. The article closes with a brief turn to a “real-life” black death-birthing narrative featured in People magazine in order to not only to suggest the breadth of media forms that utilize black death-birthing narratives centering on childhood and disaster, but also to begin to interrogate the material conditions that enable the proliferation of these narratives as well as the narratives’ material effects.

Extending courts‐as‐communities scholarship and research on policy implementation practices, we use U.S. Sentencing Commission data from 2004 to 2019 to model outcomes for several measures of prosecutorial discretion in federal drug trafficking cases, including the use of mandatory minimum charges and prosecutor‐endorsed departures, to test the impact of the policy changes on case processing outcomes. We contrast prosecutorial measures with measures that are more impervious to discretionary manipulation, such as criminal history, and those that represent judicial and blended discretion, including judicial departures and final sentence lengths. We find a significant effect of the policy reforms on how prosecutorial tools are used across DOJ policy periods, and we find variation across districts as a function of contextual conditions, consistent with the court communities literature. We also find that a powerful driver of changes in prosecutorial practices during our most recent period is the confirmation of individual Trump‐appointed U.S. Attorneys at the district level, suggesting an important theoretical place for midlevel actors in policy translation and implementation.",cc-by-nc-nd-4.0,,,

To measure US lethal violence holistically, we reconceptualize the traditional definitional boundaries of violence to erase arbitrary distinctions between state- and civilian-caused crime and violence. Discussions of the “crime decline” focus specifically on civilian crime, positioning civilians as the sole danger to the health, wealth, and safety of individuals. Violence committed by the state—from police homicide to deaths in custody to in-prison sexual assault—is not found in the traditionally reported crime rate. These absences belie real dangers posed to individuals which are historical and contemporary, nonnegligible, and possibly rising. We present Uniform Crime Report data side-by-side with data on police killings, deaths in custody, and executions from sources such as Fatal Encounters, the Washington Post, the Guardian, and the Center for Disease Control to produce a robust discussion of deaths produced through the criminal legal system. We ground this empirical analysis in a broader conceptual framework that situates state violence squarely within the realm of US crime, and explore the implications of this more holistic view of crime for future analyses.

To examine rates of sexually transmitted infections as a function of jail and prison incarceration rates across US counties for the years 2011 to 2016.Methods. We used data from several national databases. The outcomes were county-level chlamydia and gonorrhea incidence as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2012-2016). The exposures were lagged specifications of county-level jail and prison incarceration rates as reported by the Vera Institute of Justice (2011-2015). We estimated mixed models to account for the 3 sources of response variable variation occurring across repeated measures collected from counties nested within states.Results. In the final model, jail and prison incarceration rates were associated with a rate increase of 10.13 per 100 000 and 8.22 per 100 000, respectively, of chlamydia incidence. The corresponding rate increases for gonorrhea incidence were 2.47 per 100 000 and 4.40 per 100 000.Conclusions. These findings provide some evidence that the documented differences in chlamydia and gonorrhea incidence between counties may be partially attributable to differences in jail and prison incarceration rates.",,31967898.0,"['Humans', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Incidence', 'Criminal Law', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Middle Aged', 'Prisoners', 'United States', 'Female', 'Male', 'Young Adult']",

We examine both the rate and length of sentences by block group. Specifically, we first estimate models for the number of prison, jail, and probation or fine sentences as rates per population and as rates per filing. We find that felony drug defendants in Black neighborhoods are penalized after filing through an increased rate of prison sentences per filing, although they do indicate a higher but not statistically significant rate of sentences per population as well. On the other hand, initial patterns of filing primarily drive sentencing in Latino neighborhoods. While the rate of prison and probation sentences differs based on the racial and ethnic neighborhood composition, it largely does not impact sentence length.",,,,

Results suggest that inequality is greatest between White non‐Latinos and Black Latinos, followed by White non‐Latinos and Black non‐Latinos, ranging from 4 to more than 8 percentage points difference in the probability of pretrial detention, 7–13 points difference in conviction, 5–6 points in prison, and 4–10 points difference in jail.

               Although scholars have documented skin tone stratification in punishment and among Hispanics in some domains, no study has examined colorism among Hispanics across multiple stages of the criminal justice process. By linking official court records and mugshot photographs of a sample of 6,523 adults arrested in Miami-Dade County between 2012 and 2015, we examine whether Hispanics are subjected to colorism, and the role of selection in shaping the association between skin color and punishment at sentencing. We find colorism in conviction and incarceration and show that selection processes partly account for some of the association between skin tone and punishment at sentencing. These findings are driven by Hispanics who are categorized as Black. Given the demographic importance of Hispanics to the future of the United States, our investigation suggests that skin stratification will continue to be an important source of inequality in American society.",,,,

               Recent highly-publicized cases of police violence have raised broader discussions around understanding use-of-force as institutional racism. We explore how variation in police practices, including discretionary stops and targeting outdoor spaces, along with racialized understandings of crime and space, help explain use-of-force in neighborhoods. Using stop-and-frisk data from the New York City Police Department (NYPD) in Census tracts (N = 12675) between 2006 and 2012, we conduct a spatial analysis and estimate multilevel negative binomial regression models. We find relationships between use-of-force incidents and police organizational practices, where police use force more often in neighborhoods where they employ greater discretionary stops, and in neighborhoods where police conduct proportionally more indoor stops. Our findings also point to understanding stop-and-frisk as a spatial strategy concentrated largely in neighborhoods of color, where police use force more often in Black and Latinx neighborhoods above and beyond the racial disproportionately of individuals stopped. Police also use force more often in neighborhoods where they perceive more crime, even after accounting for the observed crime rate. We suggest that use-of-force by the NYPD is systematically produced through organizational practices paired with shared racialized understandings of crime and space that vary across neighborhoods.",,,,

                  Objective
                  Develop an approach, One-class-at-a-time, for triaging psychiatric patients using machine learning on textual patient records. Our approach aims to automate the triaging process and reduce expert effort while providing high classification reliability.
               
               
                  Materials and Methods
                  The One-class-at-a-time approach is a multistage cascading classification technique that achieves higher triage classification accuracy compared to traditional multiclass classifiers through 1) classifying one class at a time (or stage), and 2) identification and application of the highest accuracy classifier at each stage. The approach was evaluated using a unique dataset of 433 psychiatric patient records with a triage class label provided by “I2B2 challenge,” a recent competition in the medical informatics community.
               
               
                  Results
                  The One-class-at-a-time cascading classifier outperformed state-of-the-art classification techniques with overall classification accuracy of 77% among 4 classes, exceeding accuracies of existing multiclass classifiers. The approach also enabled highly accurate classification of individual classes—the severe and mild with 85% accuracy, moderate with 64% accuracy, and absent with 60% accuracy.
               
               
                  Discussion
                  The triaging of psychiatric cases is a challenging problem due to the lack of clear guidelines and protocols. Our work presents a machine learning approach using psychiatric records for triaging patients based on their severity condition.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  The One-class-at-a-time cascading classifier can be used as a decision aid to reduce triaging effort of physicians and nurses, while providing a unique opportunity to involve experts at each stage to reduce false positive and further improve the system’s accuracy.

One of the well-known frameworks for organizing, developing, and deploying predictive machine learning models is cross-industry standard for data mining (CRISP-DM). However, the framework does not provide any guidelines for detecting and mitigating different types of fairness-related biases in the development of ML applications. The study of these biases is a relatively recent stream of research. To address this significant theoretical and practical gap, we propose a new framework—Fair CRISP-DM, which groups and maps these biases corresponding to each phase of an ML application development. Through this study, we contribute to the literature on ML development and fairness. We present recommendations to ML researchers on including fairness as part of the ML evaluation process. Further, ML practitioners can use our framework to identify and mitigate fairness-related biases in each phase of an ML project development. Finally, we also discuss emerging technologies which can help developers to detect and mitigate biases in different stages of ML application development.",,,,

While attributes of health literate organizations have been proposed, approaches for strengthening them in healthcare systems with limited resources have not been fully detailed. Methods We conducted key informant interviews with individuals from 11 low resourced health care organizations serving uninsured, underinsured, and government-insured patients across Missouri. The qualitative inquiry explored concepts of impetus to transform, leadership commitment, engaging staff, alignment to organization wide goals, and integration of health literacy with current practices. Findings Several health care organizations reported carrying out health literacy related activities including implementing patient portals, selecting easy to read patient materials, offering community education and outreach programs, and improving discharge and medication distribution processes. The need for change presented itself through data or anecdotal staff experience. For any change to be undertaken, administrators and medical directors had to be supportive; most often a champion facilitated these changes in the organization. Staff and providers were often resistant to change and worried they would be saddled with additional work. Lack of time and funding were the most common barriers reported for integration and sustainability. To overcome these barriers, managers supported changes by working one on one with staff, seeking external funding, utilizing existing resources, planning for stepwise implementation, including members from all staff levels and clear communication. Conclusion Even though barriers exist, resource scarce clinical settings can successfully plan, implement, and sustain organizational changes to support health literacy. ",,,,

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a collaborative effort between a health care organization and academic institution to strengthen organizational health literacy.


Design/methodology/approach
The intervention took place at a rural, federally qualified health clinic in Missouri between May 2009 and April 2011. Qualitative interviews of key informants were conducted before (n=35) and after (n=23) the intervention to examine program implementation and success in effecting organizational change.


Findings
Intervention activities helped establish a comprehensive understanding of health literacy. The project achieved moderate, fundamental and sustainable organizational change. The program successfully integrated health literacy practices into clinic systems and garnered leadership and organizational commitment, helped the workforce improve interpersonal communication and embedded practices making health education materials more accessible.


Originality/value
The study points to programmatic, conceptual and methodological challenges that must be addressed for organizations to improve health literacy practices, and suggests change management strategies to advance organizational health literacy.

We translated SNS for implementation in a home visitation organization in order to increase its capacity to effectively address injury prevention and decrease the burden of injury experienced by high-need families. The aim of this study was to identify behavioral and organizational barriers and facilitators to translating and implementing SNS in a home visitation setting. Nurse home visitors (NHVs) participated in semistructured interviews that examined perceptions of program implementation, intervention characteristics, individual characteristics of NHVs, and recommendations for improving implementation. The utility of the program for promoting injury prevention systematically and its alignment with the organization’s mission were facilitators of successful implementation. Barriers included NHVs’ concerns about overburdening clients and missed educational opportunities related to injury risks not addressed by the program and delayed delivery of educational reports. Findings illustrate the dynamic interactions of intervention characteristics with organizational and individual factors and suggest that customizing implementation to organizational capacity and specific needs may better support successful program implementation in home visitation settings.

Finally, consistent with informed traders favoring option market activities due to short‐sale costs and/or constraints, we find option based return predictability is more evident within REITs than non‐REITs, even though firms within this industry are generally viewed as informationally transparent.",,,,

Decoupling these two covariance component risk effects is important because they can offset one another at the firm level, masking unique market influences on total systematic risk.

However, identifying freight activity stops from global positioning system (GPS) data is challenging, particularly in urban freight where congested traffic is common. This paper presents a mechanistic—because it is based on the physics of driving patterns—procedure to identify freight activity stops from raw GPS data. The procedure was implemented to identify stops in three distinct case studies that present a wide range of traffic conditions: Barranquilla, Colombia; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and New York City, United States. The results show that the procedure achieves an average accuracy of above 98.6% when identifying freight activity stops. The results of the proposed procedure were compared with results from support vector machines, random forest, and k nearest neighbors. The mechanistic procedure outperformed these methods in correctly classifying freight activity using second-by-second GPS data. ",,,,

The efforts of this partnership have induced more than 400 commercial establishments in NYC to accept OHD without supervision. The economic benefits are considerable: the carriers have reduced operational costs and parking fines by 45 percent; the receivers enjoy more reliable deliveries, enabling them to reduce inventory levels; the truck drivers have less stress, shorter work hours, and easier deliveries and parking; the delivery trucks produce 55–67 percent less emissions than they would during regular-hour deliveries, for a net reduction of 2.5 million tons of CO2 per year; and citizens’ quality of life increases as a result of reduced conflicts between delivery trucks, cars, bicycles, and pedestrians, and through the use of low-noise delivery practices and technologies that minimize the impacts of noise. The total economic benefits exceed $20 million per year. The success of the OHD program is due largely to the policy design at its core, made possible with the behavioral microsimulation. This unique optimization-simulation system incorporates the research conducted into an operations research/management science tool that assesses the effectiveness of alternative policy designs. This enabled the successful implementation of the project within the most complex urban environment in the United States. ",,,,

Drawing on findings from the gentrification and residential preference literatures, we hypothesize that the percentage of Black and Latino residents in neighborhoods in 1980 is associated with the probability of gentrification, conditional on the racial composition of neighborhoods in 2010. We test these hypotheses with analyses of census data for tracts in the central cities of Chicago and New York in 1980 to 2010. We find that the percentage of Black residents in 1980 was negatively associated with gentrified White and positively associated with gentrified Black neighborhoods, and that percent Latino in 1980 was positively associated with gentrified Latino neighborhoods. Finally, we found strong evidence that gentrification in these cities was much more likely to occur in neighborhoods close to the central business district. ",,,,

We argue that past work has not fully considered the role of racial steering in maintaining segregation. To explore patterns of steering, we use the 2012 Housing Discrimination Study along with Census data on the neighborhood racial and socioeconomic composition of housing units shown to testers. We leverage the experimental design of the audits to examine how neighborhoods of homes shown to auditors change dynamically throughout the search process and to assess the conditions under which steering is most likely. As with past research, we find no evidence of steering in Asian-White or Hispanic-White audits. However, we find consistent evidence that Black testers are steered away from White neighborhoods and toward Blacker ones, particularly for female homeseekers and those with children. We also find that steering occurs relatively early in the search process and is heightened when searches begin in racially-homogenous neighborhoods. These findings support arguments that the steering of Black homeseekers serves as a modest but stubborn mechanism by which segregation is maintained, and highlight the intersectionality of race and gender in determining outcomes.",cc-by-4.0-legalcode,,,

Female 3.5-month-olds exhibited a preference for the WHR associated with attractiveness and mate value by adults (0.7) over a larger WHR (0.9). This preference was exhibited when infants were tested on upright stimuli but not when they were tested on inverted stimuli, indicating that low-level differences (e.g., curviness) were not driving performance.

However, very little is known about infants’ representation of human hands. In Experiment 1, infants tested in a familiarization/novelty preference task discriminated between images of intact hands and images that contained first-order structure distortions (i.e., with locations of fingers altered to result in an unnatural configuration). In Experiment 2, infants tested in a spontaneous preference task exhibited a preference for scrambled hand images over intact images, indicating that 3.5-month-olds have gained sufficient sensitivity to the configural properties of hands to discriminate between intact versus scrambled images without any training in the laboratory. In both procedures, infants’ performance was disrupted by the inversion of images, suggesting that infants’ performance in upright conditions was not based on low-level features. These results indicate that sensitivity to the structure of hands develops early in life. This may lay the foundation for the development of the functional use of hand information for social communication.",,,,

                  Background
                  Human interaction begins with visual evaluation of others, and this often centers on the face. Objective measurement of this evaluation gives clues to social perception.
               
               
                  Objectives
                  The objective of this study was to use eye-tracking technology to evaluate if there are scanpath differences when observers view faces of cisgender men, cisgender women, and transgender women before and after facial feminization surgery (FFS) including when assigning tasks assessing femininity, attractiveness, and likability.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Undergraduate psychology students were prospectively recruited as observers at a single institution. Their eye movements were recorded by eye-tracking technology when they were presented with frontal photographs of prototypical male, prototypical female, and pre- and post-FFS faces in a random order and then with prompting to assess femininity, attractiveness, and likability.
               
               
                  Results
                  Twenty-seven observers performed the tasks. Participants focused their attention more on the central triangle of post-FFS and prototypical female images and on the forehead of pre-FFS and prototypical male images. Higher femininity ratings were associated with longer proportional fixations to the central triangle and lower proportional fixations to the forehead.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  This preliminary study implies the scanpath for viewing a post-FFS face is closer to that for viewing a prototypical female than a prototypical male based on differences viewing the forehead and brow vs the central triangle.

Using a familiarization paired‐comparison procedure, 6.5‐month‐olds in the current experiments were familiarized to happy, angry, or sad emotions in faces or bodies and tested with the opposite image type portraying the familiar emotion paired with a novel emotion. Infants looked longer at the familiar emotion across faces and bodies (except when familiarized to angry images and tested on the happy/angry contrast). This matching occurred not only for emotions from different affective categories (happy, angry) but also within the negative affective category (angry, sad).

In this article, we review studies on infants' knowledge about the structure of bodies and their processing of gender and emotion that paint a different picture. Although questions remain, a general social cognition system likely engenders similar trajectories of development of knowledge about faces and bodies, and may equip developing infants with the capacity to obtain socially critical information from many sources.",,,,

This opens the door for the use of vaccine delivery by drones (uncrewed aerial vehicles, or UAVs) with their fast transportation and reliance on little or no infrastructure. In this paper, we study the problem of strategic multimodal vaccine distribution, which simultaneously determines the locations of local distribution centers, drone bases, and drone relay stations, while obeying the cold chain time limit and drone range. Two mathematical optimization models with complementary strengths are developed. The first model considers the vaccine travel time at the aggregate level with a compact formulation, but it can be too conservative in meeting the cold chain time limit. The second model is based on the layered network framework to track the vaccine flow and travel time associated with each origin-destination (OD) pair. It allows the number of transshipments and the number of drone stops in a vaccine flow path to be limited, which reflects practical operations and can be computationally advantageous. Both models are applied for vaccine distribution network design with two types of drones in Vanuatu as a case study. Solutions with drones using our parameter settings are shown to generate large savings, with differentiated roles for large and small drones. To generalize the empirical findings and examine the performance of our models, we conduct comprehensive computational experiments to assess the sensitivity of optimal solutions and performance metrics to key problem parameters.

Since EMS is a public service, it is natural for the community to expect equitable service from these systems; however, there is not a unique agreement on how to measure equity. Most EMS planning literature focuses solely on measures of efficiency, such as minimizing average response time. Solutions based on optimizing efficiency measures alone can be unacceptable when they are achieved at the expense of some players. Such trade‐offs can be more crucial when it comes to high‐priority emergencies. We provide a multicriteria optimization approach aimed at identifying good solutions for several equity and efficiency measures together, based on a joint modeling approach for location and dispatching policy decisions, while considering multiple levels of call priority. We apply our approach to a real‐world data set. We show that the joint approach provides better solutions than using the common assignment of the closest available ambulance, in particular for the equity criteria. We quantify the trade‐offs between different performance measures, and provide Pareto‐efficient solutions. The proposed joint optimization approach can be used to gain insight about the implicit balance between common efficiency measures and discussed equity criteria, hence providing better information to policy makers and EMS system administrators.",,,,

Process evidence suggests this happens because heirloom creators (i.e., givers) have a primary motive to inspire their offspring to strive for accomplishments in their own right. In this regard, such heirlooms appear to be less about creators ensuring their personal achievement legacies are never forgotten, but more about creators leveraging their achievements to motivate the creation of larger, collective legacies by their families by those in following generations. Such findings have implications for both firms wishing to extend the life of the objects they produce and heirloom recipients who may stronger connect with the underlying intentions of the original possessing ancestors.",cc-by-nc-nd,,,

Our study investigates this dynamic, asking how episodes of electoral violence affect existing levels of foreign direct investment. We argue that, when managing their investments in foreign markets, multinational firms weigh the expected gains of the investment with the probability that the host country experiences significant lapses in political stability. Electoral violence signals a greater risk of this undesirable outcome and, thus, increases the probability that firms divest in favor of more favorable investment environments. Using firm-level data, we investigate the investment behavior of seventy-seven multinational firms in twenty-five Sub-Saharan African countries from 1995 to 2008 with a series of logistic regression models. Directly modeling the choices that firms make with respect to yearly changes in investment, we demonstrate that firms are more likely to divest following events of electoral violence in a host country. This study carries important implications for our understanding of how electoral violence may undermine the economic stability of emerging economies.",,,,

Existing research, however, has not explored the human costs of sovereign default, though some link the fiscal flexibility afforded by sovereign creditworthiness to improved human rights performance. But what are the consequences when sovereigns lose all creditworthiness and default on their debt obligations? I argue that while the average effect of default is negative for respect for physical integrity rights, a conditional effect exists. When states devote more of their resources to debt service and default, they are likely to see a short term increase in respect for physical integrity rights. I find robust support for these arguments using panel data on over 90 developing countries from 1981–2010.",cc-by-4.0,,,

In this article, I use Joan Acker's theory of gendered organizations to examine Hollywood talent agencies as one case of these powerful intermediary organizations. The power structures, promotion process, mentoring networks and discourses described by the talent agents I interviewed privilege white men. The agents interviewed for this study described their top management as being overwhelmingly composed of men, they discussed the patrimonial systems of mentorship and exclusive male networks that advantage white men, and talked about colleagues and clients in ways that valorized elite masculinity and disparaged femininity. Thus, the organizational structures and culture of these talent agencies collectively create an environment that reproduces itself, encouraging white men to join and persist, and presenting barriers to women and racial minority men. Although the focus of this article is on Hollywood talent agencies, the findings from this research help explain how inequality is reproduced in the non‐traditional work arrangements that characterize the new economy.",,,,

Central to this debate is a binary that constructs police officers as fulfilling either a protective, community-serving role, or an aggressive, crime-fighting role. The most recent iteration is reflected in the warrior-guardian construct, which conceptualizes officers as both initiators of, and defenders against, violence. This article examines how the warrior-guardian framework shapes police training, and highlights how this construct is itself gendered and racialized. I draw on one year of ethnographic field work at four police academies and 40 interviews with police officers and cadets to argue that police training is an organized effort to condition officers to conceptualize their relationship with the public as a war. Three components constitute this framing: (1) instructors construct an evil, unpredictable enemy; (2) cadets are taught to identify their enemy in gendered and racialized ways; and (3) cadets are encouraged to adopt a warrior mentality. I show that cadets are taught to view the world in a way that pits them against an enemy, pushes them to conceptualize their enemy as a man of color, and to think about violence as a moral necessity.",,,,

The Nonprofit Studies Minor at North Carolina State University identified five nonprofit leadership challenges, through a combination of practitioner experience and academic research, that could serve as a typology. The challenges identified are earning the public trust; aligning mission, methods, and resources; capitalizing on issues associated with diversity; balancing individual interests and the common good; and moving beyond charity to systemic change. This research revisits the academic literature to assess whether these challenges encompass the research agenda of nonprofit and voluntary action academic studies. Using qualitative content analysis, we examined abstracts from three major nonprofit journals from 2005-2017. Results indicate that the five leadership challenges were present in the abstracts of all three journals. Chi-squared analysis showed statistically significant differences in the presence of leadership challenges based on journal, location of the study, and unit of analysis. Validating this typology strengthens the Institute’s efforts and inform research and practice throughout the field.",,,,

These paradoxes are pervasive, and they can jeopardize consumer welfare because they are difficult to navigate. In this conceptual article, we argue that the principles of wisdom provide a unique and constructive lens through which to view the social media landscape with the aim of maximizing well‐being. We illustrate three social media paradoxes at individual, interpersonal, and societal levels of analysis. We also translate wisdom theory into practical recommendations for consumers, marketers, and public policy makers to facilitate wiser use of social media. Finally, we propose avenues for future transformative consumer research on how wisdom can help consumers to fruitfully approach paradoxes in the context of social media and beyond.",,,,

However, the potential generalizability of these conclusions to nonresearch settings has not yet been investigated.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We conducted a multidimensional meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of cCBT for anxiety and/or depressive disorders quantifying generalizability by examining the relationship between participant exclusion and treatment outcome. Thirty-six trials of cCBT were identified through systematic searches in six databases. The number of exclusion criteria and exclusion rate served as indices of participant exclusion. Outcome variables included between- and within-group effect sizes in addition to rates of clinically significant improvement.<h4>Results</h4>Analyses were performed for all studies, depression studies (n = 11), and anxiety studies (n = 23). Pooling across all studies, we found a between-group effect size of 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.94). The mean number of exclusionary criteria was 12 (range, 2-24), and the mean exclusion rate was 0.49 (range, 0.08-0.92). Risk for suicide was the most common criterion for exclusion. Correlation analyses revealed a large relationship between number of exclusion criteria and proportion clinically changed in the treatment group for anxiety studies (r = 0.70). Results provide evidence for the limited effectiveness of cCBT for anxiety disorders in nonresearch samples.<h4>Conclusions</h4>As computerized therapy is developed to address barriers to dissemination, future trials should examine the effectiveness of cCBT for anxiety for patients with more complex clinical presentations.",,26461235.0,"['Meta-analysis', 'Mental health', 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy', 'E-health', 'Exclusionary Criteria', 'Computerized Psychotherapy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Internet', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",PMC4860668

Recent evidence shows internet-delivered dialectic behaviour therapy (iDBT) skills training can reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity. However, further studies are needed to provide more definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of iDBT skills training in the chronic pain population.Methods and analysisA single-case experimental design (SCED) with multiple baselines will be used to examine the efficacy of a 4-week iDBT-Pain skills training intervention (iDBT-Pain intervention) to reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity in individuals with chronic pain. The iDBT-Pain intervention encompasses two components: (1) iDBT-Pain skills training sessions (iDBT-Pain sessions) and (2) the iDBT-Pain skills training web application (iDBT-Pain app). Three individuals with chronic pain will be recruited and randomly allocated to different baseline phases (5, 9 or 12 days). Following the baseline phase, participants will receive six 60–90 min iDBT-Pain sessions approximately 4 or 5 days apart, delivered by a psychologist via Zoom. To reinforce learnings from the iDBT-Pain sessions, participants will have unlimited use of the iDBT-Pain app. A 7-day follow-up phase (maintenance) will follow the intervention, whereby the iDBT-Pain sessions cease but the iDBT-Pain app is accessible. Emotional regulation, as the primary outcome measure, will be assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Pain intensity, as the secondary outcome measure, will be assessed using a visual analogue scale. Generalisation measures will assess psychological state factors (depression, anxiety and coping behaviour), alongside sleep quality, well-being and harm avoidance. SCEDs are increasingly considered effective designs for internet-delivered psychological interventions because SCED enables the investigation of interindividual variability in a heterogeneous population such as chronic pain.Ethics and disseminationThis trial was approved by the University of New South Wales (HC200199). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.Trial registration numberACTRN12620000604909.",cc-by-nc-4.0,,,

            Background
            People with suicidal thoughts are more inclined to seek technology-delivered interventions than in-person forms of treatment, making mobile apps for suicide prevention an ideal platform for treatment delivery. This review examines apps designed for suicide prevention, with a specific focus on user engagement.
          
          
            Objective
            This study aims to update the literature and broadly evaluate the landscape of mobile health apps for suicide prevention; examine apps with key features and primary approaches to suicide prevention; and systematically evaluate the engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information of the apps.
          
          
            Methods
            All apps related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors were identified in the Google Play and iOS app stores and were systematically reviewed for their content and quality. The mobile app rating scale (MARS) was used to evaluate app usability and engagement.
          
          
            Results
            Of the 66 apps identified, 42 (64%) were specifically designed for people with suicidal ideation, and 59 (89%) had at least one best practice feature for suicide risk reduction. The mean overall MARS score of all apps was 3.5 (range 2.1-4.5), with 83% (55/66) of apps having a minimum acceptability score of 3. The total MARS score was not associated with the user app rating (r=−0.001; P=.99) or the number of features (r=0.24; P=.09).
          
          
            Conclusions
            This study identified many usable and engaging apps in app stores designed for suicide prevention. However, there are only limited apps for clinicians. Thus, mobile apps for suicide prevention should be carefully developed and clinically evaluated.

                Background
                The gap between treatment need and treatment availability is particularly wide for individuals seeking Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and mobile apps based on DBT may be useful in increasing access to care and augmenting in-person DBT. This review examines DBT based apps, with a specific focus on content quality and usability.
              
                Methods
                All apps referring to DBT were identified in Google Play and iOS app stores and were systematically reviewed for app content and quality. The Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) was used to evaluate app usability and engagement.
              
                Results
                A total of 21 free to download apps were identified. The majority of apps (71%) included a component of skills training, five apps included a diary card feature. Most (76.19%) apps were designed to function without help from a therapist. The average user “star” rating was 4.39 out of 5. The mean overall MARS score was 3.41, with a range of 2.15 to 4.59, and 71.43% were considered minimally ‘acceptable,’ as defined by a score of 3 or higher. The average star rating was correlated with the total MARS score (r = .51, p = .02). Estimates of app usage differed substantially between popular and unpopular apps, with the three most popular apps accounting for 89.3% of monthly active users.
              
                Conclusions
                While the present study identified many usable and engaging apps in app stores designed based on DBT, there are limited apps for clinicians. DBT based mobile apps should be carefully developed and clinically evaluated.

                Background
                Smartphone applications could improve symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in a scalable and resource-efficient manner in the context limited access to specialized care.
              
                Objective
                This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of applications designed as treatment interventions for adults with symptoms such as anger, suicidality, or self-harm that commonly occur in BPD.
              
                Data sources
                Search terms for BPD symptoms, smartphone applications, and treatment interventions were combined on PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO from database inception to December 2019.
              
                Study selection
                Controlled and uncontrolled studies of smartphone interventions for adult participants with symptoms such as anger, suicidality, or self-harm that commonly occur in BPD were included.
              
                Study appraisal and synthesis methods
                Comprehensive Meta-Analysis v3 was used to compute between-groups effect sizes in controlled designs. The primary outcome was BPD-related symptoms such as anger, suicidality, and impulsivity; and the secondary outcome was general psychopathology. An average dropout rate across interventions was computed. Study quality, target audiences, therapeutic approach and targets, effectiveness, intended use, usability metrics, availability on market, and downloads were assessed qualitatively from the papers and through internet search.
              
                Results
                Twelve studies of 10 applications were included, reporting data from 408 participants. Between-groups meta-analyses of RCTs revealed no significant effect of smartphone applications above and beyond in-person treatments or a waitlist on BPD symptoms (Hedges’ g = − 0.066, 95% CI [−.257, .125]), nor on general psychopathology (Hedges’ g = 0.305, 95% CI [− 0.14, 0.75]). Across the 12 trials, dropout rates ranged from 0 to 56.7% (M = 22.5, 95% CI [0.15, 0.46]). A majority of interventions studied targeted emotion dysregulation and behavioral dyscontrol symptoms. Half of the applications are commercially available.
              
                Conclusions
                The effects of smartphone interventions on symptoms of BPD are unclear and there is currently a lack of evidence for their effectiveness. More research is needed to build on these preliminary findings in BPD to investigate both positive and adverse effects of smartphone applications and identify the role these technologies may provide in expanding mental healthcare resources.

This case study illustrates the implementation of a PE protocol into standard DBT treatment, specifically focusing on the management of self-harm and severe dissociation for a client with co-occurring PTSD and BPD. The client entered into treatment with severe and persistent dissociation and a recent history of self-harm, and the case includes consideration of two separate pauses in PTSD treatment related to elevated dissociation and self-harm behaviors. The client successfully completed the DBT PE protocol and results indicate significant improvements in PTSD symptoms as well as outcomes related to self-harm and dissociation.

Building on part-set cuing theory, the authors propose that examples increase recall when they cue low-accessibility subcategories of events, but may decrease recall when they cue high-accessibility subcategories. Further, cuing with examples rather than subcategory names may in some situations clarify questions and reduce non-useable open-ended responses.

Of these tools, accelerators have proliferated in number and variety over the past couple decades. However, growing evidence suggests that these programs are not equally effective, varying in form and function with disparate outcomes. Initial evidence indicates that the effectiveness of accelerators varies by entrepreneurial ecosystem features, such as density and university involvement. Current scholarship is limited, however, in that it doesn't provide an adequate explanation for why that is the case. In this paper we use creative class theory to explain the distinct advantages of an accelerator powered by an urban, metropolitan, research university. Chief among these advantages are the dense and diverse networks that comprise urban research universities and the value that each network participant contributes. In addition, we posit that it is the amplification of these collective contributions that are critical to startup success and the overall vitality of the entrepreneurial ecosystem within the region.

Recent research suggests that graduate education and supervision has little effect on client outcomes. Investigations of expertise development have given rise to deliberate practice, a framework which structures skill development research and instruction. Deliberate practice involves individualized coaching, repetition, and solo practice in development of optimal performance. This conceptual article introduces deliberate practice as a framework for enhancing effectiveness of counselor education and supervision practices. Applications of deliberate practice to teaching and supervision and suggestions for future research are provided. What is the public significance of this article?: Counseling pedagogy uses a variety of methods in classrooms and supervision to help novice counselors develop key skills for their work. Deliberate Practice may be an effective method to help counselors develop more effective skills for working with their clients. Deliberate Practice provides a unified framework to help integrate common methods across teaching and supervision, and emphasizes the use of repetitive practice and individualized feedback.",,,,

Results from a statewide assessment of the first year of State Targeted Response implementation showed increases and improvements in overall treatment admissions, medication utilization, and treatment retention. The current study, which focuses on the St. Louis region, the epicenter of Missouri’s overdose crisis, examines whether improvements were experienced equally among Black and White clients. Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis using state-level billing records for individuals with OUD receiving services through publicly-funded substance use treatment programs between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2019, with claimed services updated through November 1, 2020. Comparisons across time periods, treatment groups, and Black and White clients were assessed using chi-square tests of independence and multivariate negative binomial regressions. Results: White individuals in St. Louis experienced larger increases in treatment admissions and utilization of medications for OUD than Black individuals, and Black clients were retained in treatment for shorter lengths of time than White clients. Conclusion: In Missouri, rates of drug overdose deaths are more than three times higher for Black people than White people. Racial inequities in OUD treatment utilization and retention must be intentionally targeted and corrected as one component of reducing this sizable disparity in fatalities. ",,,,

When patients present with low health literacy, physicians' skills may be lacking, which can put patients' safety and satisfaction at risk. The authors' developed and executed a simulation-based needs assessment following conflicting internal reports about the communications skills of new residents.<h4>Methods</h4>The current study recruited first year residents (<i>N</i> = 30) during the 2019 first post-graduate year (PGY-1) orientation at a southeastern university hospital simulation center. The residents completed an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) which focused on obtaining informed consent from a patient's health care proxy who presented with limited literacy and health literacy and poor communication skills. After completing the OSCE, the residents, simulated patients (SP), and independent observers assessed the residents' performance.<h4>Results</h4>Residents assessed their performance higher when compared with the ratings from independent observers and patient raters. Residents who spent more time with SPs were given higher ratings by the SPs and independent observers. Finally, residents' ratings of themselves had a positive correlation with their reported confidence, but no correlation between self-confidence and the ratings provided by SPs or observers.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PGY-1 residents demonstrate a continued need for health literacy and informed consent education, despite faculty believing that these skills were covered enough in medical school. These residents also demonstrated limited self-assessment ability or skills below the expectations of health literacy experts. Curriculum changes included improving the focus on health literacy, communication skills, and additional practice opportunities throughout their internship year.",,36919812.0,"['Informed consent', 'Internship And Residency', 'Curriculum', 'Health Literacy', 'Simulation Training', 'Humans', 'Education, Medical, Graduate', 'Internship and Residency', 'Needs Assessment']",

This study examines whether three psychosocial aspects (temperance, perspective, responsibility) relevant to the maturity of judgment predict within-individual and between-individual differences in levels of perceptual deterrence. Random effects regression models with fixed effects (hybrid models) are used to estimate the impact of maturity of judgment on the perceived risks, costs, and benefits of crime among a sample of serious juvenile offenders from the Pathways to Desistance study over 7 years of development. The results support both within-person effects and between-person effects. More mature judgment ability is generally associated with the perception of greater risks, heavier costs of punishment, and fewer rewards of crime. The rate of change in perceptual deterrence by maturity of judgment varies between individuals. Implications of the findings are discussed.",,,,

This study uses record data encompassing 3,034 youth from a multi-state study to examine dispositional and treatment decisions associated with the Ohio Youth Assessment System (OYAS). Specifically, mediation analyses were conducted to evaluate how current practices align with underlying logic and theory regarding the role of assessments in juvenile justice. Findings reveal varied and complex relationships between assessment scores, case decisions, and recidivism. While risk was generally associated with recidivism, our results suggest juvenile risk and need assessments are inconsistently used to inform case management and placement decisions.

Four distinctive subgroups of youth were identified, two of which reported more than a minimal degree of informant discrepancy across all domains of delinquent behavior. One subgroup exhibited higher maternal-reported delinquency in comparison with youth reports, and one subgroup exhibited higher youth-reported delinquency in comparison with maternal reports. Additionally, risk factors (e.g., peer delinquency, caregiver monitoring) and delinquency-related difficulties (e.g., police contact) were associated with youth placement in the LCA-identified subgroups. Study findings suggest that youth with higher levels of self-reported delinquency compared with maternal reports may be at greater risk for delinquency-related difficulties due to problems related to inadequate monitoring by caregivers combined with greater involvement with peer delinquency.

These efforts include deliberate attempts and policy decisions enacted to reduce the number of incarcerated youths. Ohio has implemented a series of initiatives in its juvenile justice system designed to reduce reliance on state custody of youth in favor of local alternatives. Using Ohio’s juvenile justice systems as a focal case, this study assessed reform initiatives on the reduction in youth incarceration and recidivism. Our analyses of 5,000 youths sampled from cases processed between 2008 and 2015 revealed a sustained trend in diverting youth from incarceration, most conspicuously among low risk youths. The diverted population, after adjusting for covariates through propensity score techniques, had lower rates of incarceration compared to the youths in state residential facilities. The outcome of the reform initiatives is discussed in terms of supporting redirection and reinvestment of finite resources and refining intervention strategies in implementing change in juvenile justice.",,,,

The present study examines whether and why youth with co-occurring mental health problems may have worse outcomes in juvenile drug court than youth who only have issues with substance use. In a sample of youth in juvenile drug court, 328 youth with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders were compared with 336 youth with only substance use disorders. Youth with co-occurring mental health problems had significantly worse criminal justice outcomes than youth without mental health problems. These outcomes were explained, in part, by more frequent violations of the drug court requirements, and in particular, violations surrounding treatment noncompliance. Results suggest that juvenile drug courts—as they currently operate—may be unsuccessfully managing youth who present with co-occurring mental health and substance use problems. Implications for policy and practice are discussed. ",,,,

Although the ability of multidrug-resistant cells to exclude drugs from the nucleus is a distinctive and possibly the main mechanism for resistance against a number of drugs, including doxorubicin, this phenomenon is not entirely understood. In this paper, the relationship between doxorubicin subcellular distribution and P-glycoprotein activity at different cell sites has been investigated by different techniques. Cytofluorometry and confocal microscopy were used to study doxorubicin subcellular distribution in U-2 OS human osteosarcoma cells and in the multidrug-resistant variant U-2 OS/DX580. Stable levels of doxorubicin accumulation were found in the nuclei of sensitive cells, whereas the absence of detectable levels of drug in the nuclei of resistant cells could be attributed to an energy-dependent mechanism. Moreover, in resistant cells, inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity was able to induce drug accumulation in the nuclei of resistant cells and to achieve cytotoxic effects comparable to those observed in sensitive cells. Similar results were also found in isolated nuclei from U-2 OS/DX580 cells. The expression of P-glycoprotein in U-2 OS/DX580 and in two other multidrug-resistant cell lines (SW948-R-300 and LoVo-R-100) was investigated by confocal microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy, by using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against this protein. Higher levels of P-glycoprotein expression, not only in the plasma membrane and inside the cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus, were found in U-2 OS/DX580 and in LoVo-R-100 multidrug-resistant cells compared to their corresponding sensitive cells. SW948-R-300 cells, featuring increased amounts of MDR1 mRNA but lacking P-glycoprotein expression at the cell surface, showed a higher P-glycoprotein immunolabeling only in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. The localization of P-glycoprotein in the nucleus of multidrug-resistant cells was confirmed also by studies on isolated nuclei and nuclear matrices, and by Western blot analysis on total cell and isolated nuclear extracts. These findings, suggesting the possible involvement of nuclear P-glycoprotein in the regulation of subcellular doxorubicin distribution in multidrug-resistant cells, open new insights on the mechanisms of P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance to anticancer drugs.",,8603675.0,"['Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Nuclear Matrix', 'Humans', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Carcinoma', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Verapamil', 'Doxorubicin', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1']",

The result is an increasingly competitive field of social service provision in which organizations must differentiate themselves in the struggle over funding, contracts, symbolic authority, and potential clients. We explore this struggle by examining the distinct roads to reentry constructed at four PVS organizations in Ontario, Canada. Our analysis initiates a dialogue between individual narratives and organizational discourses, contending that the road to reentry is coauthored among organizations and criminalized individuals—albeit on unequal terms. Our findings reveal that there are significant pressures for criminalized individuals to perform narrative labor to align themselves with organizational understandings of reentry. Such pressures include: the denial of services or social assistance payments, threats of being returned to prison for “inadequate” participation in rehabilitation, and risks of not being considered for coveted “professional ex” positions at PVS organizations. In light of these empirical findings, we also offer a conceptual reflection on the challenges criminalized individuals likely face accessing services from multiple organizations with differing roads to reentry, suggesting that navigating these diverse roads not only requires narrative labor, but also narrative dexterity.

It was interestingly found that as high as 75.6% yield of glycolic acid over 2.3 wt% Bi/β was achieved from cellulose at 180 °C for 16 h, which was superior to previously reported catalysts. Experimental results combined with characterization revealed that the synergetic effect between oxidation active sites from Bi species and surface acidity on H-β together with appropriate total surface acidity significantly facilitated the chemoselectivity towards the production of glycolic acid in the direct, one-pot conversion of cellulose.

In this study, a new type of coating filler consisting of graphene oxide/polyaniline/polydopamine (GO-PANI-PDA) nanocomposites has been successfully synthesized. The morphology, structure, composition, and corrosion resistance performance of the GO-PANI-PDA (GPP) nanocomposites were investigated via a series of characterization methods. The results from our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization curve and salt spray experiment showed that the best corrosion resistance performance of the coating is from GPP 21 with the epoxy/GO-PANI:PDA ratio of 2:1, which exhibited a positive corrosion potential (−0.51 V) shift from epoxy/GO-PANI coating (−0.64 V). The corrosion current density (3.83 × 10−8 A/cm2) of GPP 21 is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of epoxy/GO-PANI (7.05 × 10−7 A/cm2). The good anti-corrosion performance was fascinatingly observed in salt spray tests even without obvious corrosion phenomenon after 30 days of testing. Due to these remarkable properties, GPP nanocomposites can be an outstanding candidate for the rapid development of broadband shielding and anticorrosive materials.",cc-by-4.0,,,

The purpose of the present study was to investigate risk factors for attrition among young children receiving trauma-focused therapy. Study participants were 189 treatment-seeking children aged 3-5 years (M = 4.86 years, SD = 0.71; 54.1% female, 47.7% White) and their nonoffending legal guardian(s). Child and family characteristics, number of traumatic events, and pretreatment posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were examined in relation to two attrition definitions: (a) clinician-rated dropout and (b) whether the child received an adequate treatment dose (i.e., 12 or more sessions). Although 70.3% of children prematurely terminated therapy per their clinician, a nearly equivalent portion (67.4%) received an adequate treatment dose. Family characteristics were largely not associated with attrition, although residing farther from the clinic was related to clinician-rated treatment dropout, OR = 0.96. As expected, higher levels of externalizing symptoms were associated with clinician-rated dropout and inadequate dose status, ORs = .95 and .96, respectively, whereas lower levels of trauma-related anger were related to clinician-rated treatment completion, OR = 1.03, and lower levels of PTSS and sexual concerns corresponded with an increased likelihood the child received an inadequate treatment dose, ORs = 1.03 and 1.02, respectively. Thus, child and family factors appear to play a small role in predicting attrition; however, higher levels of externalizing problems and lower levels of PTSS may increase the risk for dropout.",,32479708.0,"['Humans', 'Risk Factors', 'Child, Preschool', 'Caregivers', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Female', 'Male', 'Psychological Trauma']",

A total of 217 civilian, trauma-exposed female undergraduate students participated in the study ( Mage = 24.30, SD = 6.83, 63.2% White). Higher levels of trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms corresponded with anger ( b = .47, 95% CI = [0.11-0.83]; b = .11, 95% CI = [0.05-0.16], respectively) and verbal aggression ( b = .50, 95% CI = [0.21-0.78]; b = .06, 95% CI = [0.01-0.10], respectively). PTSD symptoms, but not cumulative trauma exposure, was associated with hostility ( b = .23, 95% CI = [0.14-0.59]), whereas physical aggression was only related to trauma exposure ( b = .69, 95% CI = [0.31-1.06]). Furthermore, there was a significant indirect effect of cumulative trauma through PTSD symptoms on anger and verbal aggression ( b = .15, 95% CI = [0.05-0.32]; b = .09, 95% CI = [0.02-0.20], respectively). Trauma-exposed civilian females with higher levels of PTSD symptoms may be at increased risk for several indices of aggressive behavior.

Gun attitudes are a potential risk factor for gun violence; however, factors related to gun attitudes have not been identified. Mental illness such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly discussed as a key factor in gun violence, despite research lacking in this area, and it is unknown whether symptoms of PTSD and probable PTSD are associated with more positive attitudes toward guns. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relations between PTSD symptoms and gun attitudes among 265 undergraduate students who experienced at least one interpersonal traumatic event ( Mage = 24.69 years, SD = 7.15 years, 75.6% female, 61.1% White). Path analysis revealed that individuals with PTSD symptoms above clinical cutoff were not more likely to have more positive gun attitudes. However, the PTSD symptom clusters evinced distinct relations with gun attitudes. Intrusion and avoidance symptoms were related to gun beliefs regarding protection, with intrusion symptoms being linked to a stronger belief that guns provide protection from crime and victimization (β = .23), whereas avoidance symptoms were inversely associated with this belief (β = −.22). Interestingly, neither trauma related in feelings and thoughts nor arousal and reactivity corresponded with gun attitudes. Certain PTSD symptom clusters may be relevant in understanding gun beliefs, with specific symptoms exhibiting distinct ties to gun attitudes. ",,,,

Here, we argue that it is critical to identify factors that underlie impaired social functioning as well as processes that mediate the beneficial health effects of positive relationships in individuals exposed to CM. Key research recommendations are presented, focusing on: (1) identifying attachment-related alterations in specific inter- and intrapersonal processes (e.g., regulation of closeness and distance) that underlie problems in broader domains of social functioning (e.g., lack of perceived social support) in individuals affected by CM; (2) identifying internal (e.g., current emotional state) and external situational factors (e.g., cultural factors, presence of close others) that modulate alterations in specific social processes; and (3) identifying mechanisms that explain the positive health effects of intact social functioning. Methodological recommendations include: (1) assessing social processes through interactive and (close to) real-life assessments inside and outside the laboratory; (2) adopting an interdisciplinary, lifespan perspective to assess social processes, using multi-method assessments; (3) establishing global research collaborations to account for cultural influences on social processes and enable replications across laboratories and countries. The proposed line of research will contribute to globally develop and refine interventions that prevent CM and further positive relationships, which – likely through buffering the effects of chronic stress and corresponding allostatic load – foster resilience and improve mental and physical health, thereby reducing personal suffering and the societal and economic costs of CM and its consequences. Interventions targeting euthymia and psychological well-being are promising therapeutic concepts in this context. ",cc-by-nc-4.0,,,

Specifically, it is unclear what factors are placing individuals with a history of child maltreatment (i.e., sexual abuse, physical abuse, and witnessing intimate partner violence [IPV]) at greater risk for subsequent adult victimization (i.e., sexual assault and IPV). Existing theoretical and empirical work on revictimization suggest that multiple risk factors are likely present within this framework (e.g., posttraumatic stress symptoms [PTSS], emotion dysregulation, and risk-taking behaviors). Prior research has suggested that PTSS are often linked with these other risk factors, and it is possible that the development of PTSS following child maltreatment may be related to the development or maintenance of additional factors that increase the likelihood of revictimization. The purpose of this review was to synthesize findings regarding risk factors that place maltreated individuals at greater risk for adult revictimization. Approximately 228 studies were identified following a thorough search of the peer-reviewed literature using multiple databases (PsycINFO, PILOTS, and Google Scholar). Each study was critically analyzed for relevance. The included studies were used in our review of prevalence, specific risk factors that have been identified, and unanswered questions in this literature. PTSS were noted to be particularly important in the revictimization framework, and thus, a novel model of revictimization was also proposed where PTSS are illustrated as being associated with the development and maintenance of other factors within the revictimization framework.

Maternal marital status was the only factor associated with clinician-rated treatment dropout, OR = 2.35, whereas maternal support and blame/doubt were unrelated. Living farther from the clinic was tied to an increased risk of receiving an inadequate treatment dose, OR = 0.96. Replication of these findings is needed, particularly using a clinician-administered measure of caregiver support; yet, maternal emotional support and blame/doubt may not evince strong ties to dropout from TFT among sexually abused children. Additional work is needed to discern if there are key subgroups for whom support is more strongly related to the risk of premature termination following CSA.",,34057745.0,"['Humans', 'Family', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', 'Psychotherapy', 'Child Abuse', 'Child', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Female', 'Male']",

The aim of the present study was to examine the associations between discordance and both maternal emotional support and blame/doubt in caregivers' and children's reports of trauma-related symptoms in sexually abused children. Participants were treatment-seeking, sexually abused children (N = 122) aged 8-12 years (M = 9.45 years, SD = 1.09; 70.5% female, 57.4% White) and their nonoffending caregivers. Low intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) indicated the presence of significant discordance across symptom types, with caregivers reporting higher levels of trauma-related difficulties, ICCs = -.21-.22. Older children were more likely to disclose higher levels of anger and sexual concerns than younger children, βs = .18-.33. Children's gender, race, and relationship to their caregiver were not related to symptom discordance. Further, maternal emotional support and blame/doubt were not associated with caregiver-child concordance for any examined difficulties. Assessment of both caregivers' and children's perceptions of trauma-related symptoms is vital given the likelihood of discordance in child and caregiver reports of symptom levels. Although maternal emotional support and blame/doubt may not be linked to concordance with regard to trauma-related difficulties, child age should further be considered as a potentially important factor in understanding caregiver-child symptom concordance.",,34710253.0,"['Humans', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Family', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', 'Child Abuse', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Caregivers', 'Female', 'Male']",

Yet, as few studies have examined these links in a multivariate manner, it is unclear which symptoms are most strongly related to SBPs and ISBPs. Research regarding children’s reports of their difficulties and SBPs and ISBPs is also very limited. The current study investigated the relations between both caregiver- and child-reported trauma-related symptoms and SBPs and ISBPs among 248 treatment-seeking sexually abused children (ages 6–12; M = 8.06, SD = 2.52; 64.5% female; 55.6% white). Children’s caregiver-reported trauma-related sexual concerns and anger were associated with SBPs. For ISBPs, only caregiver-reported sexual concerns were related to ISBPs. Surprisingly, none of the child-reported symptoms were associated with either SBPs or ISBPs. Trauma-related sexual concerns and anger may be tied to SBPs, whereas other clinical difficulties may be less strongly implicated. Trauma-related sexual concerns may be most important in understanding interpersonally focused SBPs. Children’s self-reported difficulties may be unrelated to caregiver-reported SBPs, or these results may be a function of a low degree of caregiver and child symptom concordance. ",,,,

Further, the associations between PTSS and parenting outcomes utilizing the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( DSM-5) post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) criteria are unknown. The aims of the current study were to determine: (a) whether trauma exposure and PTSS are related to parenting indices; (b) if trauma exposure is associated with parenting factors indirectly through PTSS; and (c) whether the DSM-5 PTSD symptom clusters are each linked with parenting outcomes. Participants were 225 trauma-exposed parents ( Mage = 36.81; SD = 8.32) from a Midwestern University or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Cumulative trauma had an indirect effect on parental satisfaction, support, involvement, limit-setting, and autonomy via PTSS. The specific PTSD symptom clusters also demonstrated distinct ties to parenting outcomes. Higher levels of alterations in reactivity and arousal symptoms were associated with lower parental support and satisfaction, as expected. Avoidance symptoms were also inversely related to parental autonomy. However, a positive relationship was noted between intrusion symptoms and support, and changes in cognitions and mood were unrelated to parenting indices. PTSS may better explain decrements in aspects of parenting than trauma exposure. Certain types of PTSD symptoms, particularly trauma-related changes in reactivity and arousal, may be relevant in understanding and improving parenting outcomes among trauma-exposed parents. ",,,,

Participants included 243 emerging adult university students of color (Mage = 20.27, SD = 1.95, 83.5% female). Linear regression analyses indicated that less frequent trauma exposure and greater perceived social support were related to lower PTSS. A significant interaction was also found between social support and exposure to community violence, such that at low levels of social support, individuals with more community violence exposure had the highest levels of PTSS. Regression and moderation analyses indicated that ethnic identity and community cohesion were not significantly associated with PTSS in this sample.

The role of pretrauma beliefs about power and control, however, remains unclear. Though a strong pretrauma belief in power and control may similarly be protective, we predicted such a belief may actually be a diathesis for PTSD. When exposed to trauma, individuals with a strong pretrauma belief in power and control may believe they should have prevented the trauma and/or their acute reactions. Such expectations may lead to negative self‐beliefs and a higher level of PTSD symptoms. Longitudinal structural equation modeling in a sample of combat soldiers (N = 305) supported our hypothesized model. Stronger predeployment power and control beliefs predicted more negative postdeployment self‐beliefs, β = .15, p = .035, 95% CI [.11, .18], and in turn, a higher level of PTSD symptoms, β = .08, 95% CI [.01, .15]. Prior combat exposure moderated these effects in that soldiers with no prior combat experience evidenced the hypothesized associations, whereas those with moderate or high prior combat exposure did not. Resilience interventions for soldiers who are first entering combat may thus benefit from promoting acceptance of uncontrollable events in addition to agentic change skills.",,,,

Yet, the literature has largely focused on sexual revictimization, while relations between maltreatment and other adult victimization types (e.g., intimate partner violence [IPV]) are less clear. Further, associations between emotion dysregulation and both child and adult trauma exposure have been identified, but aspects of dysregulation (i.e., nonacceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior, impulsivity, lack of emotional awareness, limited access to ER strategies, and lack of emotional clarity) have received less attention. This study aimed to: (1) investigate the associations between maltreatment and adult victimization and the six ER dimensions while accounting for PTSS, and (2) determine whether there are indirect effects between maltreatment and adult victimization through each ER component. Seven hundred and forty-four undergraduates from two universities participated in the study ( Mage = 21.48, SD = 4.12; 80.9% women; 56.2% white). Maltreatment and PTSS were directly linked with adult victimization ( B = 0.14, B = 0.01, respectively). PTSS was inversely associated with each ER aspect ( Bs = 0.02–0.10). Unexpectedly, neither maltreatment nor adult victimization was related to the ER dimensions, and no indirect effects were observed between maltreatment and adult victimization through emotion dysregulation. These findings suggest that specific components of emotion dysregulation may not be tied to trauma exposure outside of PTSS. Further, it may be that the ER dimensions are not differentially related to increased risk for adult victimization. ",,,,

Two hierarchical linear regression models examined associations between individual (i.e., emotion dysregulation, anger severity), relational (i.e., family support, friend support), and contextual (i.e., community cohesion, community disorder) factors, and PTSS and resilience. At the individual level, higher emotion dysregulation was associated with higher PTSS and lower resilience; anger severity was not related to either outcome. At the relational level, more friend support was negatively associated with PTSS. Friend and family support were positively related to resilience. At the contextual level, community cohesion was positively associated with resilience, but not PTSS, and community disorder was unrelated to both outcomes. Findings demonstrate unique factors across the social ecology that differentially relate to PTSS and resilience. Variables at all three ecological levels were associated with resilience, whereas only individual and relational variables were related to PTSS. Replication with longitudinal data could inform treatments for trauma-exposed individuals that may mitigate PTSS and bolster resilience. ",,,,

Rates of premature termination have varied across studies, and to date, no meta-analyses have been conducted regarding dropout from TF-CBT. The objective of the present study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the rates of attrition from TF-CBT, as well as review factors related to premature termination from this intervention. A total of 22 studies were available for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The prevalence of attrition was 33.9% (95% CI [26.2%, 42.5%]) from 2,059 children receiving TF-CBT. Clinician-rated attrition was 38.5%, and 17.5% did not receive an adequate dose of TF-CBT (e.g., 12+ sessions). Further, the study type was related to differing rates of dropout, with randomized controlled trials having a much lower attrition rate. Regarding risk factors for premature termination, the emerging literature suggests that a child's age, racial-ethnic minority status, and symptom levels may evince some ties to attrition. Caregiver, family, therapist, and treatment factors remain underexplored in relation to premature termination; however, preliminary work suggests that lack of caregiver attendance and difficulty in the child-therapist relationship may be related to attrition.

However, there are discrepancies regarding the factor structure of event centrality, as the factor structure may differ depending on the nature of the trauma. Event centrality has predicted posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); yet, few studies have taken into account other key cognitive predictors of PTSD, such as posttraumatic cognitions. The PTSD symptom clusters also remain largely unexamined, despite potential specificity in their ties to event centrality. The aims of the current study were to: (a) examine the factor structure of event centrality and whether the structure differs following interpersonal versus noninterpersonal trauma; (b) investigate whether event centrality predicts PTSD symptom clusters beyond posttraumatic cognitions; and (c) determine if the associations between event centrality, posttraumatic cognitions, and PTSD are equivalent between trauma types. The study aims were examined utilizing 263 college students (Mage = 24.54, SD = 6.29; 79.8% female; 58% White). Event centrality was best represented by one factor, which was consistent between groups.

Rates of clinician-rated attrition were high (76.2%); however, 73.8% received an adequate dose. Despite expectations, higher levels of rule-breaking and aggressive behavior were related to clinician-rated dropout ( d = 0.59, .63, respectively) but were not significant predictors in a logistic regression model. Child-reported symptoms were unrelated to clinician-rated attrition. Higher levels of caregiver-reported anxiety/depression, somatic complaints, and trauma-related difficulties corresponded with adequate dose ( ds = 0.52–1.06). Yet only caregiver-reported sexual concerns predicted adequate dose in a regression model ( OR = 1.09). Caregiver- and child-reported symptoms may be unrelated to clinician-rated treatment completion and appear to play a small role in understanding whether the child received an adequate dose of treatment.

(Re)Politicizing the anthropologist in the Age of Neoliberalism and,2017.0,"[{'given': 'Sarah A.', 'family': 'Lacy', 'name': 'Sarah A.

Beyond contributing service to what Sara Ahmed describes as the “non‐performativity” of diversity statements, scholars are expected to follow the precedent set by university administration, which is usually one of silence and denial punctuated by vociferous apology through targeted resignations post‐incident. Although race has long been a dominant research theme, anthropologists are rarely asked by administration to facilitate debate on the role of the academic setting in creating social and political change. This article explores the responses of universities coupled with the purposeful exclusion of anthropologists and other social scientists from administrative committees and policy decisions. Assuming Louis Althusser's theory of the ideological state apparatus, we examine the ways university bureaucracies have propagated neoliberal ideas and strategies for achieving racial equality and how the strategies utilized by the university are dictated by its funding needs. Specific examples draw from the experiences and observations of the authors—an assistant professor of anthropology and a community organizer–graduate student—juxtaposing the responses of two local university administrations to protests in Ferguson, as well as detailing nonproductive attempts of these campus communities to engage structural racism and the Ferguson community.",,,,

                  Objective
                  To investigate cognitive impairments associated with binge drinking, 78 college undergraduates (ages 18 to 50, M = 21, SD = 5.23) were recruited and categorized into alcohol use groups based on their reported consumption patterns (non-drinking, social drinking, or binge drinking).
               
               
                  Method
                  Participants completed a modified Stroop task to examine differential interference between alcohol and neutral targets and an attention network task (ANT) to measure within and between group variance in attentional performance across the alerting, orienting, and executive control networks.
               
               
                  Results
                  There were no significant performance differences between alcohol use groups on either task. However, a significant negative association between alcohol Stroop interference and executive control performance was observed for both the binge and social drinking groups, β = .033, t(48) = 3.81, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [.016, .051]. This was a moderately large effect (η2p = .23) which was not significant for non-drinking individuals.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  This experiment provides evidence that attentional interference from alcohol stimuli indicates broader executive control impairment in alcohol users, further illustrating the role of this domain in problematic drinking behaviors. Our findings affirm the significance of executive control assessment in the screening and treatment protocol for alcohol use disorders.

Furthermore, research has not examined the associations between trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and aggression using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) PTSD criteria. The primary aim of the current study was to investigate the relationships between trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and aggression among women. The secondary aim was to examine the specific PTSD symptom clusters in relation to indices of aggression. A total of 217 civilian, trauma-exposed female undergraduate students participated in the study ( Mage = 24.30, SD = 6.83, 63.2% White). Higher levels of trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms corresponded with anger ( b = .47, 95% CI = [0.11-0.83]; b = .11, 95% CI = [0.05-0.16], respectively) and verbal aggression ( b = .50, 95% CI = [0.21-0.78]; b = .06, 95% CI = [0.01-0.10], respectively). PTSD symptoms, but not cumulative trauma exposure, was associated with hostility ( b = .23, 95% CI = [0.14-0.59]), whereas physical aggression was only related to trauma exposure ( b = .69, 95% CI = [0.31-1.06]). Furthermore, there was a significant indirect effect of cumulative trauma through PTSD symptoms on anger and verbal aggression ( b = .15, 95% CI = [0.05-0.32]; b = .09, 95% CI = [0.02-0.20], respectively). Trauma-exposed civilian females with higher levels of PTSD symptoms may be at increased risk for several indices of aggressive behavior. Furthermore, PTSD symptoms may better account for some, but not all, aspects of aggression in trauma-exposed women. ",,,,

                  Introduction
                  There is a long history of pre-deployment PTSD prevention efforts in the military and effective pre-deployment strategies to prevent post-deployment PTSD are still needed.
               
               
                  Materials and Methods
                  This randomized controlled trial included three arms: heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB), cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I), and control. The hypothesis was that pre-deployment resilience training would result in lower post-deployment PTSD symptoms compared with control. Army National Guard soldiers (n = 342) were enrolled in the Warriors Achieving Resilience (WAR) study and analyzed. The outcome was PTSD symptom severity using the PTSD Checklist – Military version (PCL) measured at pre-deployment, 3- and 12-month post-deployment. Due to the repeated measures for each participant and cluster randomization at the company level, generalized linear mixed models were used for the analysis. This study was approved by the Army Human Research Protection Office, Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System Institutional Review Board (IRB), and Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System IRB.
               
               
                  Results
                  Overall, there was no significant intervention effect. However, there were significant intervention effects for subgroups of soldiers. For example, at 3-months post-deployment, the HRVB arm had significantly lower PCL scores than the control arm for soldiers with no previous combat zone exposure who were age 30 and older and for soldiers with previous combat zone exposure who were 45 and older (unadjusted effect size −0.97 and −1.03, respectively). A significant difference between the CBM-I and control arms was found for soldiers without previous combat zone exposure between ages 23 and 42 (unadjusted effect size −0.41). Similarly, at 12-months post-deployment, the HRVB arm had significantly lower PCL scores in older soldiers.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  Pre-deployment resilience training was acceptable and feasible and resulted in lower post-deployment PTSD symptom scores in subgroups of older soldiers compared with controls. Strengths of the study included cluster randomization at the company level, use of iPod device to deliver the resilience intervention throughout the deployment cycle, and minimal disruption of pre-deployment training by using self-paced resilience training. Weaknesses included self-report app use, study personnel not able to contact soldiers during deployment, and in general a low level of PTSD symptom severity throughout the study. In future studies, it would important for the study team and/or military personnel implementing the resilience training to be in frequent contact with participants to ensure proper use of the resilience training apps.

Although nonsexual trauma exposure has been linked to aggression, the associations between sexual assault and aggression are understudied. Further, the DSM‐5 conceptualization of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) includes a symptom related to aggression, and associations between symptom clusters and aggression with regard to the new criteria are underexplored. The present study aimed to (a) examine the relations between sexual assault and indices of aggression (i.e., physical/verbal aggression, anger, and hostility) after accounting for PTSS and (b) investigate PTSD symptom clusters in relation to aggression among 263 women (Mage = 29.03 years, SD = 11.71; 67.6% white). Path analysis revealed that sexual assault was unrelated to indices of aggression, βs = .003–.08; however, PTSS was consistently linked with increased aggression, βs = .22–.49. Results indicated specificity in the associations between the symptom clusters and aspects of aggression. Negative alterations in cognitions and mood corresponded with increased physical aggression, β = .28, and hostility, β = .38, and avoidance was related to verbal aggression, β = .19. Hyperarousal was also tied to higher levels of anger, hostility, and verbal aggression, βs = .21–.33. Nonetheless, lower levels of intrusion symptoms were associated with increased anger and hostility, β = ‐.26. With regard to understanding women's risk for aggression, PTSS may be more relevant than sexual assault. Further, there may be specificity related to the type of PTSD symptoms and aspects of aggression.",,,,

Gun attitudes are a potential risk factor for gun violence; however, factors related to gun attitudes have not been identified. Mental illness such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly discussed as a key factor in gun violence, despite research lacking in this area, and it is unknown whether symptoms of PTSD and probable PTSD are associated with more positive attitudes toward guns. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relations between PTSD symptoms and gun attitudes among 265 undergraduate students who experienced at least one interpersonal traumatic event ( Mage = 24.69 years, SD = 7.15 years, 75.6% female, 61.1% White). Path analysis revealed that individuals with PTSD symptoms above clinical cutoff were not more likely to have more positive gun attitudes. However, the PTSD symptom clusters evinced distinct relations with gun attitudes. Intrusion and avoidance symptoms were related to gun beliefs regarding protection, with intrusion symptoms being linked to a stronger belief that guns provide protection from crime and victimization (β = .23), whereas avoidance symptoms were inversely associated with this belief (β = −.22). Interestingly, neither trauma related in feelings and thoughts nor arousal and reactivity corresponded with gun attitudes. Certain PTSD symptom clusters may be relevant in understanding gun beliefs, with specific symptoms exhibiting distinct ties to gun attitudes. ",,,,

Of increasing interest is the relative ability of different types of labels to steer consumers away from unhealthy options (aversion) versus steer them towards healthier options (attraction). The aim of this study was to assess aversion and attraction outcomes for five FoPLs (Health Star Rating, Multiple Traffic Lights, Nutri-Score, Reference Intakes, and Warning Label) across 18 countries (n = 18393). Descriptive analyses assessed improvements in consumer understanding and choice outcomes for each label across three different types of food products. Binary logistic regressions were used to compare the relative ability of the labels to improve respondents’ understanding of product healthiness and their product choices, using the industry-developed Reference Intakes as the comparator. Aversion and attraction effects were assessed for each label/food type combination. Across the total sample, the Nutri-Score performed best in terms of both attraction and aversion results for understanding and simulated choice outcomes, followed by the Multiple Traffic Lights. The Reference Intakes exhibited the weakest performance overall, with the Warning Label and Health Star Rating falling in between. The most effective FoPLs featured a colour-coded spectrum design. The results indicate that front-of-pack labels that are effective in guiding consumers towards healthier food products can also be effective in steering them away from unhealthy options.",,,,

The comprehensive dataset included all reported field-free, gas phase spectroscopic data for PtS, including 32 Fourier transform microwave transitions (estimated accuracy: 1 kHz), 9 microwave/optical double resonance transitions (25 kHz), 51 millimeter and submillimeter transitions (25–50 kHz), 469 molecular beam-laser induced fluorescence transitions (0.003 cm−1), and 4870 ILS transitions (0.005 cm−1). The determined equilibrium constants have been used with the Rydberg-Klein-Rees method to produce potential energy curves for the four known electronic states of PtS. Isotopic shifts in electronic transition energy beyond expectations from the Born-Oppenheimer approximation were observed and treated as electronic field-shift effects due to the difference in the nuclear charge radius between Pt isotopes.

Using the same coding method, the 2011 JIT article, ‘Business Process Outsourcing Studies: A Critical Review and Research Directions,’ analyzed 615 findings on the determinants of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) decisions and outcomes from 67 empirical articles published between 1996 and 2011. Taken together, these two reviews found that the preponderance of evidence from both ITO and BPO research streams produced largely consistent results pertaining to the categories of independent variables that affected outsourcing decisions and outcomes. To investigate the most current research findings on business services, which comprise ITO and BPO, and to compare the results with the prior JIT reviews, we replicated the method used in the prior JIT reviews. In this update, we examined 174 newly published articles across 78 academic journals published between 2010 and 2014. We found that researchers have significantly expanded the variables of interest in the last 4 years. In all, researchers investigated 69 new variables. Compared with earlier research, this review of recent articles found a deeper exploration of the direct effects of transaction attributes, sourcing motivations, client and provider capabilities, and governance on sourcing decisions and outcomes. Researchers have also studied a broader variety of sourcing decisions, including shared services, captive centers, rural sourcing and backsourcing. This update also found a more nuanced understanding of relational governance and its interaction with contractual governance. We assessed the research progress that has been made on ten previously identified gaps in knowledge. We proposed a future research agenda that includes continued, incremental progress on ‘normal science’ research questions, as well as more ambitious research goals. We challenged researchers to investigate how sourcing clients, providers, and advisors can protect jobs, protect the environment, and ensure security in an increasingly automated world. ",,,,

It introduces a conceptual framework consisting of four dimensions drawn from entrepreneurship literature: primary mission, success criteria, resource mobilization and innovation approach – that characterize entrepreneurial impact sourcing service providers. These four dimensions are anchored across ideal types of social and commercial institutional logics to explicitly account for and capture the dual social and commercial value orientations of impact sourcing service providers as acknowledged in the literature. We evaluate the utility of this framework by using it to assess a US‐based business process outsourcing social enterprise that focuses on the underserved workforce of military veterans and spouses of military personnel. We found that this firm used social logic for both the firm's primary mission and the firm's resource mobilization; it used commercial logic for its success criteria, and it used both logics for its innovation. Our analysis of the case substantiates the applicability of the framework for capturing variation in how impact sourcing providers may selectively draw upon different logics across the four dimensions. © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd",,,,

This study investigates role hazard, a critical yet understudied relational coordination problem. Drawing on role and institutional theories, we examine role ambiguity and role conflict as two facets of role hazard between buyer and supplier, their institutional source, performance outcomes, and firms’ action alignment mechanisms as potential remedies. A dyadic survey of buyers and suppliers in China reveals that both role ambiguity and role conflict can result from sub‐national institutional distance and jeopardize supply chain performance. The results also suggest that supply chain partners in different sub‐national institutions can mitigate role hazard through continuous information sharing and dynamic adaptation. This study provides novel insights into how buyers and suppliers can enhance their relational coordination in emerging markets by reducing role hazard caused by sub‐national institutional distance.",,,,

Cross-Subsidization in Teacher Pension Benefits: Examining Rates of Return among School Districts,2020.0,"[{'given': 'James V.', 'family': 'Shuls', 'name': 'James V.

For instance, individuals who receive relatively larger late-career raises will receive disproportionately greater returns. For teachers, whose salaries are determined by salary schedules set by districts, these differences may be nonrandom, with larger raises accruing to teachers in more advantaged school districts. Using salary schedules from 490 school districts, the authors estimate the rate of return on contributions for each district. They then analyze the relationship between district characteristics and the rate of return. They find that the rate of return varies markedly among school districts, with larger and generally more affluent school districts benefiting. These findings demonstrate how salary structures and current pension design lead to cross-subsidization of pension benefits among school districts. ",,,,

The question of who enters into treatment for their opioid abuse and under what circumstances is complex and shaped by multiple factors. The objective of the current study is to explore the risk factors for wide-ranging and numerous barriers to treatment among social media users. Method Opioid-related forums within a popular social media platform were used to recruit non-treatment engaged individuals (≥15 years) who had misused opioids in the past month ( n = 144; 66% male; median age 28). Four treatment barrier factors were identified utilizing principle component analysis: (1) stigma, (2) awareness, (3) attitudinal, and (4) denial. A structural equation model (SEM) was then created to explore the risk factors for different types of barriers to OUD treatment. Results The most common barriers among participants not engaged in treatment for their opioid misuse were the belief that one should be able to help themselves with their condition (66%), treatment was too expensive (63%), and worries about being labeled or judged (57%). Additionally, SEM results demonstrate stigma barriers, awareness, and attitudinal barriers were associated with mental health comorbidities, opioid abuse and dependence severity, and treatment history. Denial barriers, however, were only associated with treatment history, and structural/financial barriers were only associated with opioid abuse and dependence severity. Conclusions Our research findings are relevant for underscoring the wide-ranging and numerous barriers to treatment faced by individuals misusing opioids that are especially concentrated among those who also struggle with comorbid mental illness.

However, close reading of the primary literature supports a different conclusion: opioids have been shown in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to be highly effective in the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain; long-term follow-up studies have shown that this effectiveness can be maintained; and effectiveness has been limited in many clinical trials by failure to take into account high variability in dose requirements, failure to adequately treat depression, and use of suboptimal outcome measures. Frequency of side effects in many RCTs has been inflated by overly rapid dose titration and failure to appreciate the high interindividual variability in side effect profiles. The recent marked increase in incidence of opioid overdose is of grave concern, but there is good reason to believe that it has been somewhat exaggerated. Potential causes of overdose include inadequately treated depression; inadequately treated pain, particularly when compounded by hopelessness; inadvertent overdose; concurrent use of alcohol; and insufficient practitioner expertise. Effective treatment of pain can enable large numbers of patients to lead productive lives and improve quality of life. Effective alleviation of suffering associated with pain falls squarely within the physician's professional obligation. Existing scientific studies provide the basis for many improvements in pain management that can increase effectiveness and reduce risk. Many potentially useful areas of further research can be identified.",,26138946.0,"['Humans', 'Analgesics, Opioid', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Chronic Pain']",PMC4548284

                The sharp rise in opioid use disorder (OUD) among women coupled with disproportionally high rates of unintended pregnancy have led to a four-fold increase in the number of pregnant women with OUD in the United States over the past decade. Supporting intentional family planning can have multiple health benefits and reduce harms related to OUD but requires a comprehensive understanding of women’s perspectives of preventing unintended pregnancies. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and experiences as they relate to seeking contraception, particularly LARCs, among women with active or recovered opioid misuse.
              
                Methods
                In-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 36 women with current or past opioid misuse were recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded by ≥ 2 investigators. Themes related to contraceptive care seeking were identified and contextualized within the Health Belief Model.
              
                Results
                Our analysis revealed seven interwoven themes that describe individual level factors associated with contraceptive care seeking in women with current or past opioid misuse: relationship with drugs, reproductive experiences and self-perceptions, sexual partner dynamics, access, awareness of options, healthcare attitudes/experiences, and perceptions of contraception efficacy/ side effects. Overall, perceived susceptibility and severity to unintended pregnancy varied, but most women perceived high benefits of contraception, particularly LARC. However, perceived barriers were too high for most to obtain desired contraception to support family planning intentions.
              
                Conclusions
                The individual-level factors identified should inform the design of integrated services to promote patient-centered contraceptive counseling as a form of harm reduction. Interventions should reduce barriers to contraceptive access, particularly LARCs, and establish counseling strategies that use open, non-judgmental communication, acknowledge the continuum of reproductive needs, explore perceived susceptibility to pregnancy, and utilize peer educators.

We aimed to identify where and how contraceptive services could be integrated into existing points-of-contact for women with OUD. Approach: In-depth qualitative interviews. Setting: Three diverse catchment areas in Missouri. Participants: Women with OUD (n = 15) and professional stakeholders (n = 16) representing five types of existing OUD service points: syringe exchange programs, recovery support programs, substance use treatment programs, emergency departments, and Federally Qualified Health Centers. Method: Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically coded using Dedoose software. Results: Six themes emerged as essential components for integrating contraceptive services into existing points-of-contact for women with OUD: (1) reach women with unmet need; (2) provide free or affordable contraception; (3) maximize service accessibility; (4) provide patient-centered care; (5) employ willing, qualified contraceptive providers; and (6) utilize peer educators. Participants affirmed the overall potential benefit of contraceptive service integration and illuminated various opportunities and challenges relevant to each type of existing service point. Conclusion: As health promotion initiatives look to increase access to contraception among women with OUD, these six’ participant-identified components offer essential guidance in selecting advantageous points-of-contact and addressing remaining gaps in services.

We investigated whether alcohol consumption helps or hinders the positivity and accuracy of social impressions using a thin-slicing paradigm to better understand the effects of alcohol in social settings and the influence of alcohol on self-expression. These possibilities were tested in a sample of 720 participants randomly assigned to consume an alcohol, placebo, or control beverage while engaged in conversation in three-person groups. We found support for the hypothesis that alcohol (compared with placebo or control) increased the positivity of observers’ personality expression, but did not find support for the hypothesis that alcohol increased the accuracy of personality expression. These findings contribute to our understanding of the social consequences of alcohol consumption, shedding new light on the interpersonal benefits that alcohol can foster. ",,,,

Outcomes and adherence to oral antibiotics for PWID with patient-directed discharge (PDD) remain understudied.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a prospective multicenter bundled quality improvement project of PWID with SIRI at 3 hospitals in Missouri. All PWID with SIRI were offered multidisciplinary care while inpatient, including the option of addiction medicine consultation and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). All patients were offered oral antibiotics in the event of a PDD either at discharge or immediately after discharge through an infectious diseases telemedicine clinic. Additional support services included health coaches, a therapist, a case manager, free clinic follow-up, and medications in an outpatient bridge program. Patient demographics, comorbidities, 90-day readmissions, and substance use disorder clinic follow-up were compared between PWID with PDD on oral antibiotics and those who completed intravenous (IV) antibiotics using an as-treated approach.<h4>Results</h4>Of 166 PWID with SIRI, 61 completed IV antibiotics inpatient (37%), while 105 had a PDD on oral antibiotics (63%). There was no significant difference in 90-day readmission rates between groups (<i>P</i> = .819). For PWID with a PDD on oral antibiotics, 7.6% had documented nonadherence to antibiotics, 67% had documented adherence, and 23% were lost to follow-up. Factors protective against readmission included antibiotic and MOUD adherence, engagement with support team, and clinic follow-up.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PWID with SIRI who experience a PDD should be provided with oral antibiotics. Multidisciplinary outpatient support services are needed for PWID with PDD on oral antibiotics.",cc-by-nc-nd,35106316.0,"['Staphylococcus aureus', 'Endocarditis', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Substance Abuse', 'Opioid Use Disorder']",PMC8801224

However, whether these stereotypes are rooted in genuine average effects or in salient, socially proliferated exemplars remains unclear. The current study tested if differences between sober and intoxicated personality expression can be observed reliably by trained raters during a drinking episode. Participants ( N = 156), half of whom received alcohol, attended laboratory sessions in same-gender friend groups and engaged in activities designed to elicit a range of personality expression. Participants completed self-reports of their “typical” sober and drunk personalities 2 weeks prior to their sessions and via two short measures during the session. In addition, participants were recorded and rated by multiple (range = 5–17) trained raters using three personality measures. Self-perceptions of sober-to-drunk personality differences were more pervasive than observer-perceptions, but alcohol-induced changes in Extraversion, specifically, were robust across measures and reporters.

Results from a statewide assessment of the first year of State Targeted Response implementation showed increases and improvements in overall treatment admissions, medication utilization, and treatment retention. The current study, which focuses on the St. Louis region, the epicenter of Missouri’s overdose crisis, examines whether improvements were experienced equally among Black and White clients. Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis using state-level billing records for individuals with OUD receiving services through publicly-funded substance use treatment programs between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2019, with claimed services updated through November 1, 2020. Comparisons across time periods, treatment groups, and Black and White clients were assessed using chi-square tests of independence and multivariate negative binomial regressions. Results: White individuals in St. Louis experienced larger increases in treatment admissions and utilization of medications for OUD than Black individuals, and Black clients were retained in treatment for shorter lengths of time than White clients. Conclusion: In Missouri, rates of drug overdose deaths are more than three times higher for Black people than White people. Racial inequities in OUD treatment utilization and retention must be intentionally targeted and corrected as one component of reducing this sizable disparity in fatalities. ",,,,

As an opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone blocks activation of the endogenous opioid system, which is involved in the affectively reinforcing properties of substance use. Few studies, however, have examined the moderating effect of naltrexone on the association between affect and alcohol use. Additionally, most existing research on naltrexone has been with adults in the human laboratory.MethodWe conducted a secondary analysis of ecological momentary assessment data from a randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled cross‐over study that compared naltrexone (50 mg/daily) and placebo in 26 adolescents (15 to 19 years old) who exhibited problematic drinking patterns. Multilevel models tested whether naltrexone moderated associations of alcohol use with both positive and negative affect (PA, NA).ResultsResults indicated that, during naltrexone treatment, greater estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) levels were associated with greater NA further into drinking episodes. In turn, greater NA after the first drink of an episode was associated with reduced subsequent eBAC values during naltrexone treatment. Low PA was also associated with lower subsequent eBAC levels in the naltrexone condition after the first drink.ConclusionsThese findings support the idea that naltrexone can disrupt the association between affect and alcohol use, effects that emerge later in drinking episodes. Greater attention to the effects of naltrexone on affect and reinforcement may help to tailor psychotherapy to maximize the benefits of naltrexone. However, in the present study, as most drink reports were in the first 2 h of the drinking episode and participants reported affect only at the first three end‐drink reports of a drinking episode (limiting the number of drinks reported), we had reduced power to detect effects in the continuation phase. Thus, replication of the findings is needed using a design that assesses the impact of naltrexone across the entire episode.",,,,

            Objective
            Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with unstable interpersonal relationships, affective instability, and physical health problems. In individuals with BPD, intense affective reactions to interpersonal stressors may contribute to the increased prevalence of health problems.
          
          
            Methods
            BPD (n = 81) and depressed participants (DD; n = 50) completed six daily ambulatory assessment prompts for 28 days. At each prompt, participants reported interpersonal stressors (disagreements, rejections, feeling let down), negative affect, and health problems in four domains (gastrointestinal, respiratory, aches, depressive symptoms). In multilevel moderated mediation models, we examined the indirect effects of interpersonal stressors on health problems via negative affect, by group.
          
          
            Results
            Interpersonal stressors were positively associated with negative affect in both groups (β values &gt; 0.12, p values &lt; .001), but more so for participants with BPD (βDay = 0.05, p &lt; .001). Negative affect was positively associated with health problems across all domains (βMoment/Day values &gt; 0.01, p values &lt; .046), but associations were larger at the day level for respiratory symptoms in BPD (β = 0.02, p = .025) and for depressive symptoms in DD (β = 0.04, p &lt; .001). Negative affect mediated the association of interpersonal stressors and health problems in both groups, with larger effects for the DD group for depressive problems (β = 0.02, p = .092) and for the BPD group for the other three domains (β values &gt; 0.02, p values &lt; .090).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Interpersonal stressors may contribute to increased physical health problems via an inability to regulate affective responses to such events. This pathway may be stronger in several health domains for those with BPD and may contribute to an elevated risk of morbidity and mortality in this disorder, suggesting a target for intervention to reduce these risks.

Few studies have tested these models in the same sample or examined factors that could explain differences in NSSI pain experience. We assessed 1,630 individuals with NSSI histories in an online survey. We examined pain during NSSI descriptively and tested pre-registered hypotheses that NSSI frequency, severity, borderline personality disorder (BPD) features, emotional pain, and dissociation are associated with experiencing less NSSI pain. Exploratorily, we also tested whether self-punishment motives were associated with less NSSI pain. Almost all participants reported recent and frequent NSSI. Participants were heterogenous in their report of NSSI pain. We found minimal support for analgesia (reported by only 4.3% of participants). More participants reported pain onset than offset, but offset was associated with reductions in emotional pain. Emotional pain was elevated prior to NSSI and decreased significantly during and after NSSI. We found that higher dissociation during NSSI was associated with less NSSI pain. Contrary to hypotheses, NSSI severity, emotional pain prior to NSSI, and self-punishment motives were associated with greater NSSI pain. NSSI frequency and BPD features were not associated with NSSI pain. BPD features interacted with dissociation and emotional pain prior to NSSI. Findings contrast with laboratory pain induction work, suggesting that, though people who self-harm may have heightened pain tolerance, they may seek to self-injure in a manner that results in pain.",cc-by-4.0-legalcode,,,

Data were analyzed using multivariate multilevel modeling to separate momentary-, day-, and person-level effects. Results revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship between disagreement and hostility, rejection and hostility, and rejection and sadness in both groups at the momentary and day level.

Following a laboratory session that captured self-report and behavioral assessments, including the well-established Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART), participants completed multiple daily assessments of alcohol craving, positive and negative affect, and risk propensity for approximately one week. Momentary risk propensity was captured in real-world settings via an EMA behavioral task (""Balloon Game""). <i>Results:</i> Mixed-effects models with EMA reports (Level 1) nested within participants (Level 2) revealed the majority (74%) of variability in ""Balloon Game"" performance was due to within-person, momentary, fluctuations. Greater momentary positive affect predicted increased alcohol craving, but only when participants exhibited heightened risk-taking propensity.

Almost all traditional fold recognition methods use sequence (homology) comparison to indirectly predict the fold of a target protein based on the fold of a template protein with known structure, which cannot explain the relationship between sequence and fold. Only a few methods had been developed to classify protein sequences into a small number of folds due to methodological limitations, which are not generally useful in practice.ResultsWe develop a deep 1D-convolution neural network (DeepSF) to directly classify any protein sequence into one of 1195 known folds, which is useful for both fold recognition and the study of sequence–structure relationship. Different from traditional sequence alignment (comparison) based methods, our method automatically extracts fold-related features from a protein sequence of any length and maps it to the fold space. We train and test our method on the datasets curated from SCOP1.75, yielding an average classification accuracy of 75.3%. On the independent testing dataset curated from SCOP2.06, the classification accuracy is 73.0%. We compare our method with a top profile–profile alignment method—HHSearch on hard template-based and template-free modeling targets of CASP9-12 in terms of fold recognition accuracy. The accuracy of our method is 12.63–26.32% higher than HHSearch on template-free modeling targets and 3.39–17.09% higher on hard template-based modeling targets for top 1, 5 and 10 predicted folds. The hidden features extracted from sequence by our method is robust against sequence mutation, insertion, deletion and truncation, and can be used for other protein pattern recognition problems such as protein clustering, comparison and ranking.Availability and implementationThe DeepSF server is publicly available at: http://iris.rnet.missouri.edu/DeepSF/.Supplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",cc-by-nc-4.0,,,

A considerable amount of effort is currently being spent to improve contact prediction accuracy, whereas few methods are available to construct protein tertiary structures from predicted contacts. Here, we present an ab initio protein folding method to build three-dimensional models using predicted contacts and secondary structures. Our method first translates contacts and secondary structures into distance, dihedral angle, and hydrogen bond restraints according to a set of new conversion rules, and then provides these restraints as input for a distance geometry algorithm to build tertiary structure models. The initially reconstructed models are used to regenerate a set of physically realistic contact restraints and detect secondary structure patterns, which are then used to reconstruct final structural models. This unique two-stage modeling approach of integrating contacts and secondary structures improves the quality and accuracy of structural models and in particular generates better β-sheets than other algorithms. We validate our method on two standard benchmark datasets using true contacts and secondary structures. Our method improves TM-score of reconstructed protein models by 45% and 42% over the existing method on the two datasets, respectively. On the dataset for benchmarking reconstructions methods with predicted contacts and secondary structures, the average TM-score of best models reconstructed by our method is 0.59, 5.5% higher than the existing method.

                  Exciting new opportunities have arisen to solve the protein contact prediction problem from the progress in neural networks and the availability of a large number of homologous sequences through high-throughput sequencing. In this work, we study how deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) may be best designed and developed to solve this long-standing problem.
               
               
                  Results
                  With publicly available datasets, we designed and trained various ConvNet architectures. We tested several recent deep learning techniques including wide residual networks, dropouts and dilated convolutions. We studied the improvements in the precision of medium-range and long-range contacts, and compared the performance of our best architectures with the ones used in existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed ConvNet architectures predict contacts with significantly more precision than the architectures used in several state-of-the-art methods. When trained using the DeepCov dataset consisting of 3456 proteins and tested on PSICOV dataset of 150 proteins, our architectures achieve up to 15% higher precision when L/2 long-range contacts are evaluated. Similarly, when trained using the DNCON2 dataset consisting of 1426 proteins and tested on 84 protein domains in the CASP12 dataset, our single network achieves 4.8% higher precision than the ensembled DNCON2 method when top L long-range contacts are evaluated.

                  Motivation
                  Deep learning has become the dominant technology for protein contact prediction. However, the factors that affect the performance of deep learning in contact prediction have not been systematically investigated.
               
               
                  Results
                  We analyzed the results of our three deep learning-based contact prediction methods (MULTICOM-CLUSTER, MULTICOM-CONSTRUCT and MULTICOM-NOVEL) in the CASP13 experiment and identified several key factors [i.e. deep learning technique, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), distance distribution prediction and domain-based contact integration] that influenced the contact prediction accuracy. We compared our convolutional neural network (CNN)-based contact prediction methods with three coevolution-based methods on 75 CASP13 targets consisting of 108 domains. We demonstrated that the CNN-based multi-distance approach was able to leverage global coevolutionary coupling patterns comprised of multiple correlated contacts for more accurate contact prediction than the local coevolution-based methods, leading to a substantial increase of precision by 19.2 percentage points. We also tested different alignment methods and domain-based contact prediction with the deep learning contact predictors. The comparison of the three methods showed deeper sequence alignments and the integration of domain-based contact prediction with the full-length contact prediction improved the performance of contact prediction. Moreover, we demonstrated that the domain-based contact prediction based on a novel ab initio approach of parsing domains from MSAs alone without using known protein structures was a simple, fast approach to improve contact prediction. Finally, we showed that predicting the distribution of inter-residue distances in multiple distance intervals could capture more structural information and improve binary contact prediction.

                  Motivation
                  A high-quality sequence alignment (SA) is the most important input feature for accurate protein structure prediction. For a protein sequence, there are many methods to generate a SA. However, when given a choice of more than one SA for a protein sequence, there are no methods to predict which SA may lead to more accurate models without actually building the models. In this work, we describe a method to predict the quality of a protein’s SA.
               
               
                  Results
                  We created our own dataset by generating a variety of SAs for a set of 1351 representative proteins and investigated various deep learning architectures to predict the local distance difference test (lDDT) scores of distance maps predicted with SAs as the input. These lDDT scores serve as indicators of the quality of the SAs.
                  Using two independent test datasets consisting of CASP13 and CASP14 targets, we show that our method is effective for scoring and ranking SAs when a pool of SAs is available for a protein sequence. With an example, we further discuss that SA selection using our method can lead to improved structure prediction.

                  Motivation
                  Significant improvements in the prediction of protein residue–residue contacts are observed in the recent years. These contacts, predicted using a variety of coevolution-based and machine learning methods, are the key contributors to the recent progress in ab initio protein structure prediction, as demonstrated in the recent CASP experiments. Continuing the development of new methods to reliably predict contact maps is essential to further improve ab initio structure prediction.
               
               
                  Results
                  In this paper we discuss DNCON2, an improved protein contact map predictor based on two-level deep convolutional neural networks. It consists of six convolutional neural networks—the first five predict contacts at 6, 7.5, 8, 8.5 and 10 Å distance thresholds, and the last one uses these five predictions as additional features to predict final contact maps. On the free-modeling datasets in CASP10, 11 and 12 experiments, DNCON2 achieves mean precisions of 35, 50 and 53.4%, respectively, higher than 30.6% by MetaPSICOV on CASP10 dataset, 34% by MetaPSICOV on CASP11 dataset and 46.3% by Raptor-X on CASP12 dataset, when top L/5 long-range contacts are evaluated. We attribute the improved performance of DNCON2 to the inclusion of short- and medium-range contacts into training, two-level approach to prediction, use of the state-of-the-art optimization and activation functions, and a novel deep learning architecture that allows each filter in a convolutional layer to access all the input features of a protein of arbitrary length.

Individual model quality assessment methods designed for recognizing some specific properties of protein structures often fail to consistently select good models from a model pool because of their limitations. Therefore, combining multiple complimentary quality assessment methods is useful for improving model ranking and consequently tertiary structure prediction. Here, we report the performance and analysis of our human tertiary structure predictor (MULTICOM) based on the massive integration of 14 diverse complementary quality assessment methods that was successfully benchmarked in the 11th Critical Assessment of Techniques of Protein Structure prediction (CASP11). The predictions of MULTICOM for 39 template-based domains were rigorously assessed by six scoring metrics covering global topology of Cα trace, local all-atom fitness, side chain quality, and physical reasonableness of the model. The results show that the massive integration of complementary, diverse single-model and multi-model quality assessment methods can effectively leverage the strength of single-model methods in distinguishing quality variation among similar good models and the advantage of multi-model quality assessment methods of identifying reasonable average-quality models. The overall excellent performance of the MULTICOM predictor demonstrates that integrating a large number of model quality assessment methods in conjunction with model clustering is a useful approach to improve the accuracy, diversity, and consequently robustness of template-based protein structure prediction.

The second method (MULTICOM‐CONSTRUCT) uses our new alignment algorithm to generate deep multiple sequence alignment to derive coevolution‐based features, which are integrated by a neural network method to predict contacts. The third method (MULTICOM‐CLUSTER) is a consensus combination of the predictions of the first two methods. We evaluated our methods on 94 CASP12 domains.

               Motivation: Sampling structural models and ranking them are the two major challenges of protein structure prediction. Traditional protein structure prediction methods generally use one or a few quality assessment (QA) methods to select the best-predicted models, which cannot consistently select relatively better models and rank a large number of models well.
               Results: Here, we develop a novel large-scale model QA method in conjunction with model clustering to rank and select protein structural models. It unprecedentedly applied 14 model QA methods to generate consensus model rankings, followed by model refinement based on model combination (i.e. averaging). Our experiment demonstrates that the large-scale model QA approach is more consistent and robust in selecting models of better quality than any individual QA method. Our method was blindly tested during the 11th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP11) as MULTICOM group. It was officially ranked third out of all 143 human and server predictors according to the total scores of the first models predicted for 78 CASP11 protein domains and second according to the total scores of the best of the five models predicted for these domains. MULTICOM’s outstanding performance in the extremely competitive 2014 CASP11 experiment proves that our large-scale QA approach together with model clustering is a promising solution to one of the two major problems in protein structure modeling.

Although recent advances in experimental approaches have greatly enhanced our capabilities to experimentally determine protein structures, the gap between the number of protein sequences and known protein structures is ever increasing. Computational protein structure prediction is one of the ways to fill this gap. Recently, the protein structure prediction field has witnessed a lot of advances due to Deep Learning (DL)-based approaches as evidenced by the success of AlphaFold2 in the most recent Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14). In this article, we highlight important milestones and progresses in the field of protein structure prediction due to DL-based methods as observed in CASP experiments. We describe advances in various steps of protein structure prediction pipeline viz. protein contact map prediction, protein distogram prediction, protein real-valued distance prediction, and Quality Assessment/refinement. We also highlight some end-to-end DL-based approaches for protein structure prediction approaches. Additionally, as there have been some recent DL-based advances in protein structure determination using Cryo-Electron (Cryo-EM) microscopy based, we also highlight some of the important progress in the field.

                  Protein model quality assessment (QA) plays a very important role in protein structure prediction. It can be divided into two groups of methods: single model and consensus QA method. The consensus QA methods may fail when there is a large portion of low quality models in the model pool.
               
               
                  Results
                  In this paper, we develop a novel single-model quality assessment method QAcon utilizing structural features, physicochemical properties, and residue contact predictions. We apply residue-residue contact information predicted by two protein contact prediction methods PSICOV and DNcon to generate a new score as feature for quality assessment. This novel feature and other 11 features are used as input to train a two-layer neural network on CASP9 datasets to predict the quality of a single protein model. We blindly benchmarked our method QAcon on CASP11 dataset as the MULTICOM-CLUSTER server. Based on the evaluation, our method is ranked as one of the top single model QA methods. The good performance of the features based on contact prediction illustrates the value of using contact information in protein quality assessment.

REALDIST: Real-valued protein distance prediction,2020.0,"[{'given': 'Badri', 'family': 'Adhikari', 'name': 'Badri Adhikari'}]",,10.1101/2020.11.28.402214,posted-content,,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,,,,2020-11-29,,"AbstractProtein structure prediction continues to stand as an unsolved problem in bioinformatics and biomedicine. Deep learning algorithms and the availability of metagenomic sequences have led to the development of new approaches to predict inter-residue distances—the key intermediate step. Different from the recently successful methods which frame the problem as a multi-class classification problem, this article introduces a real-valued distance prediction method REALDIST. Using a representative set of 43 thousand protein chains, a variant of deep ResNet is trained to predict real-valued distance maps. The contacts derived from the real-valued distance maps predicted by this method, on the most difficult CASP13 free-modeling protein datasets, demonstrate a long-range top-L precision of 52%, which is 17% higher than the top CASP13 predictor Raptor-X and slightly higher than the more recent trRosetta method. Similar improvements are observed on the CAMEO ‘hard’ and ‘very hard’ datasets. Three-dimensional (3D) structure prediction guided by real-valued distances reveals that for short proteins the mean accuracy of the 3D models is slightly higher than the top human predictor AlphaFold and server predictor Quark in the CASP13 competition.",cc-by-nc-nd,,,

Recent findings show that inter-residue distance prediction, a more granular version of the well-known contact prediction problem, is a key to predicting accurate models. However, deep learning methods that predict these distances are still in the early stages of their development. To advance these methods and develop other novel methods, a need exists for a small and representative dataset packaged for faster development and testing. In this work, we introduce protein distance net (PDNET), a framework that consists of one such representative dataset along with the scripts for training and testing deep learning methods. The framework also includes all the scripts that were used to curate the dataset, and generate the input features and distance maps. Deep learning models can also be trained and tested in a web browser using free platforms such as Google Colab. We discuss how PDNET can be used to predict contacts, distance intervals, and real-valued distances.",cc-by-4.0,,,

            Objective:
            To develop a predictive model of neurocognitive trajectories in children with perinatal HIV (pHIV).
          
          
            Design:
            Machine learning analysis of baseline and longitudinal predictors derived from clinical measures utilized in pediatric HIV.
          
          
            Methods:
            Two hundred and eighty-five children (ages 2–14 years at baseline; Mage = 6.4 years) with pHIV in Southeast Asia underwent neurocognitive assessment at study enrollment and twice annually thereafter for an average of 5.4 years. Neurocognitive slopes were modeled to establish two subgroups [above (n = 145) and below average (n = 140) trajectories). Gradient-boosted multivariate regressions (GBM) with five-fold cross validation were conducted to examine baseline (pre-ART) and longitudinal predictive features derived from demographic, HIV disease, immune, mental health, and physical health indices (i.e. complete blood count [CBC]).
          
          
            Results:
            The baseline GBM established a classifier of neurocognitive group designation with an average AUC of 79% built from HIV disease severity and immune markers. GBM analysis of longitudinal predictors with and without interactions improved the average AUC to 87 and 90%, respectively. Mental health problems and hematocrit levels also emerged as salient features in the longitudinal models, with novel interactions between mental health problems and both CD4+ cell count and hematocrit levels. Average AUCs derived from each GBM model were higher than results obtained using logistic regression.
          
          
            Conclusion:
            Our findings support the feasibility of machine learning to identify children with pHIV at risk for suboptimal neurocognitive development. Results also suggest that interactions between HIV disease and mental health problems are early antecedents to neurocognitive difficulties in later childhood among youth with pHIV.

               Motivation: Speed, accuracy and robustness of building protein fragment library have important implications in de novo protein structure prediction since fragment-based methods are one of the most successful approaches in template-free modeling (FM). Majority of the existing fragment detection methods rely on database-driven search strategies to identify candidate fragments, which are inherently time-consuming and often hinder the possibility to locate longer fragments due to the limited sizes of databases. Also, it is difficult to alleviate the effect of noisy sequence-based predicted features such as secondary structures on the quality of fragment.
               Results: Here, we present FRAGSION, a database-free method to efficiently generate protein fragment library by sampling from an Input–Output Hidden Markov Model. FRAGSION offers some unique features compared to existing approaches in that it (i) is lightning-fast, consuming only few seconds of CPU time to generate fragment library for a protein of typical length (300 residues); (ii) can generate dynamic-size fragments of any length (even for the whole protein sequence) and (iii) offers ways to handle noise in predicted secondary structure during fragment sampling. On a FM dataset from the most recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction, we demonstrate that FGRAGSION provides advantages over the state-of-the-art fragment picking protocol of ROSETTA suite by speeding up computation by several orders of magnitude while achieving comparable performance in fragment quality.

Almost all traditional fold recognition methods use sequence (homology) comparison to indirectly predict the fold of a target protein based on the fold of a template protein with known structure, which cannot explain the relationship between sequence and fold. Only a few methods had been developed to classify protein sequences into a small number of folds due to methodological limitations, which are not generally useful in practice.ResultsWe develop a deep 1D-convolution neural network (DeepSF) to directly classify any protein sequence into one of 1195 known folds, which is useful for both fold recognition and the study of sequence–structure relationship. Different from traditional sequence alignment (comparison) based methods, our method automatically extracts fold-related features from a protein sequence of any length and maps it to the fold space. We train and test our method on the datasets curated from SCOP1.75, yielding an average classification accuracy of 75.3%. On the independent testing dataset curated from SCOP2.06, the classification accuracy is 73.0%. We compare our method with a top profile–profile alignment method—HHSearch on hard template-based and template-free modeling targets of CASP9-12 in terms of fold recognition accuracy. The accuracy of our method is 12.63–26.32% higher than HHSearch on template-free modeling targets and 3.39–17.09% higher on hard template-based modeling targets for top 1, 5 and 10 predicted folds. The hidden features extracted from sequence by our method is robust against sequence mutation, insertion, deletion and truncation, and can be used for other protein pattern recognition problems such as protein clustering, comparison and ranking.Availability and implementationThe DeepSF server is publicly available at: http://iris.rnet.missouri.edu/DeepSF/.Supplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",cc-by-nc-4.0,,,

Distance prediction comes in two forms: real-valued distances and ‘binned’ distograms, which are a more finely grained variant of the binary contact prediction problem. The latter has been introduced as a new challenge in the 14th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) 2020 experiment. Despite the recent proliferation of methods for predicting distances, few methods exist for evaluating these predictions. Currently only numerical metrics, which evaluate the entire prediction at once, are used. These give no insight into the structural details of a prediction. For this reason, new methods and tools are needed.ResultsWe have developed a web server for evaluating predicted inter-residue distances. Our server, DISTEVAL, accepts predicted contacts, distances, and a true structure as optional inputs to generate informative heatmaps, chord diagrams, and 3D models. All of these outputs facilitate visual and qualitative assessment. The server also evaluates predictions using other metrics such as mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and contact precision.ConclusionsThe visualizations generated by DISTEVAL complement each other and collectively serve as a powerful tool for both quantitative and qualitative assessments of predicted contacts and distances, even in the absence of a true 3D structure.",cc-by-4.0,,,

Multidomain proteins can be challenging for protein structure modeling, particularly those for which templates can be found for individual domains but not for the entire sequence. In such cases, homology modeling can generate high quality models of the domains but not for the orientations between domains. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reports the structural properties of entire proteins and has the potential for guiding homology modeling of multidomain proteins. In this article, we describe a novel multidomain protein assembly modeling method, SAXSDom that integrates experimental knowledge from SAXS with probabilistic Input-Output Hidden Markov model to assemble the structures of individual domains together. Four SAXS-based scoring functions were developed and tested, and the method was evaluated on multidomain proteins from two public datasets. Incorporation of SAXS information improved the accuracy of domain assembly for 40 out of 46 critical assessment of protein structure prediction multidomain protein targets and 45 out of 73 multidomain protein targets from the ab initio domain assembly dataset. The results demonstrate that SAXS data can provide useful information to improve the accuracy of domain-domain assembly.

Millions who develop breast cancer are younger than retirement age and at a lifetime risk for developing BCRL. Rural and small-town survivors may face unique challenges in terms of access to health care and BCRL/survivorship resources. This multiple-case study describes how BCRL influences the work experiences and quality of life (QoL) of survivors living in rural and small towns in Missouri.<h4>Methods and materials</h4>Thirteen survivors from rural and small towns in Missouri completed semi-structured interviews and a standardized QoL instrument. Cases were analyzed using in-vivo and open-coding techniques and constant cross-case comparative methods. Twelve of the 13 participants' data are synthesized into themes to represent an illustrative case. The 13<sup>th</sup> case is presented as a contradictory (rival) case.<h4>Results</h4>Four themes are represented within the illustrative case - multiple medical encounters; the development of self-care routines; the reciprocity of work/live activities, triggers, and adjustments; and rural/small-town cultural impact. Upon BCRL diagnosis, survivors received intensive treatments, eventually establishing self-care routines. Survivors identified strategies for working around their BCRL when completing work and home responsibilities. The contradictory (rival) case was more recently diagnosed and, as such, had not established self-care and coping mechanisms in the same way.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>Survivors alleviate BCRL symptoms and improve their QoL by establishing self-care strategies. This provides guidance for client-centered survivorship care-planning and occupational rehabilitation of rural survivors with BCRL. This study provides the foundation for developing information for rural survivors that supports mental preparation and coping skills for BCRL self-management.",cc-by-nc-nd,34563789.0,"['Rural Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Breast Cancer Survivorship', 'Breast Cancer-related Lymphedema', 'Return-to-work', 'Humans', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Lymphedema', 'Quality of Life', 'Aged', 'Middle Aged', 'Rural Population', 'Female', 'Return to Work', 'Cancer Survivors']",PMC8688269

Factors such as delayed diagnosis, late-stage disease, and a high percentage of service occupations may challenge work choices for Latinas after BCRL diagnosis. Methods: Our multiple case study explored work experiences and quality of life (QOL) for Hispanic/Latina survivors. Participants completed demographic and short form-36 (SF-36) surveys. Semi-structured interviews focused on how work environment, self-management, and QOL were influenced by BCRL. Thematic analysis of cases used In Vivo and descriptive coding and constant cross-case comparative methods. Results: Analysis illustrated how Hispanic/Latina survivors perceive the influence of BCRL on work experience as requiring adaptation and personal resilience. Participants identified BCRL knowledge gap challenges and described coping with physical, psychosocial, and work activity changes. They described creative work adaptations and discussed BCRL’s impact on both positive and negative interpersonal perceptions. Strong support from family, friends, and colleagues contributed to improved QOL and continued work activities. Conclusion: Future research should incorporate coping strategies and creative management of BCRL to optimize work activities across the lifespan. These strategies can provide guidance for the creation of survivorship care plans, education of healthcare professionals (HCPs), and lifelong occupational support. ",,,,

We identified and coded 63 articles that used IRT on empirical data published in industrial-organizational and organizational behavior journals since 2000. Results show that typical usage for IRT conforms to best practices in several ways; however, in other ways, such as testing for and reporting model fit, there is still significant room for improvement. Next, we surveyed academic and practitioner members of the Society for Industrial-Organizational Psychology (SIOP) on their experiences and attitudes toward IRT. We conclude that IRT is one area where practice outpaces science. There is a cadre of practitioners that consider IRT essential to their professional life. For others, however, IRT is seen as less relevant. Based on our coding analyses and survey results, we provide suggestions on how to better incorporate IRT into organizational research and practice.

We documented and analyzed the perspectives of mental health therapists in the context of a randomized control trial (RCT) intervention within the Mekong Project in Cambodia. The research questions explored perceptions of therapists’ care of mental health clients, therapist well-being, and experiences of navigating within a research environment in which SGM citizens with mental health concerns receive treatment. The larger study enrolled 150 Cambodian adults, among which 69 identified as SGM. Three key patterns emerged across our interpretations. Clients seek help when symptoms interfere with daily life, therapists care for clients and themselves, and integrated research and practice is integral yet sometimes paradoxical. Therapists did not identify differences in terms of how they work with SGM clients compared with non-SGM clients. Future studies are warranted to examine a reciprocal academic-research partnership in which we examine therapists’ work alongside rural community members, evaluate the process of embedding and fortifying peer supports within educational systems, and study the wisdom of traditional and Buddhist healers to address the discrimination and violence that citizens who identify as SGM disproportionately suffer.

Thus, experience-induced changes in V1 are often interpreted as improving visual perception (i.e., perceptual learning). Here we describe how, with experience, cue-evoked oscillations emerge in V1 to convey expected reward time as well as to relate experienced reward rate. We show, in chronic multisite local field potential recordings from rat V1, that repeated presentation of visual cues induces the emergence of visually evoked oscillatory activity. Early in training, the visually evoked oscillations relate to the physical parameters of the stimuli. However, with training, the oscillations evolve to relate the time in which those stimuli foretell expected reward. Moreover, the oscillation prevalence reflects the reward rate recently experienced by the animal. Thus, training induces experience-dependent changes in V1 activity that relate to what those stimuli have come to signify behaviorally: when to expect future reward and at what rate.",,26134643.0,"['Visual cortex', 'Behavior', 'Oscillation', 'timing', 'Reward', 'Local Field Potential', 'Visual Cortex', 'Animals', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Electroencephalography', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Analysis of Variance', 'ROC Curve', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Stereotyped Behavior', 'Learning', 'Cues', 'Psychophysics', 'Action Potentials', 'Fourier Analysis', 'Male']",PMC4571501

Deterrence theorists argue that general and specific deterrence can be achieved through such policing strategies. Labeling proponents, however, maintain that juveniles stopped and/or arrested by the police, rather than be deterred, will actually engage in more delinquency as a result of this contact. Research to date has provided mixed evidence. The current study seeks to inform this debate by examining the effect of being stopped or arrested on subsequent delinquent behavior and attitudes. Relying on three waves of data from a multisite sample of youth, we use propensity score matching to control for preexisting differences among youth who have and have not experienced police contact. Our findings reveal that being stopped or arrested not only increases future delinquency but also amplifies deviant attitudes. ",,,,

The procedural justice framework suggests this delinquency amplification is due, in part, to the negative consequences of police contact on evaluations of the police. Using four waves of data, we explore the multiple ways in which being stopped or arrested and procedural injustice act in concert to affect later delinquency. We also assess how these effects differ based on youth’s evaluations of their police encounters. Our findings indicate that the total effect of being stopped or arrested on delinquency depends on the youth’s level of satisfaction with the encounter. In addition, procedural injustice mediates some of the effect of contact on delinquency, but its relationship with delinquency is not direct. We conclude that the negative consequences of being stopped or arrested are mitigated, but not eliminated, when contact is perceived favorably.",,,,

From 2002 to 2012, 91,145 crashes involving large trucks were recorded in Missouri, resulting in 1,156 fatalities and 18,457 injuries. Many factors contribute to the severity of a large truck crash; these factors and their effects on severity may vary as a function of gender. Missouri crash data from 2002 to 2012 were analyzed to identify circumstances that increased the probability of injury severity outcomes in the event of a large truck crash. Chi-square automatic interaction detector decision tree models were developed for each gender to understand predictor importance better and to uncover interactions between contributing factors. Results suggest that the major correlations with levels of injury severity are following too closely, physical impairment, and improper passing for female Missouri drivers with a commercial driver’s license (CDL) and driving too fast for conditions, failing to yield, and physical impairment for male Missouri CDL drivers. Results suggest that environmental factors are not significant predictors of severity outcome for female CDL drivers; however, road and lighting conditions play a tertiary role for male CDL drivers. Recommendations based on study results include encouraging truck driver training programs to focus educational efforts on gender-specific behaviors that affect crash injury severity to enhance road safety.

These practices include screening for injury, having appropriate emergency medical care, and protocols for managing injury before return-to-play. The extent of the uptake of these practices in a developing country such as Uganda, is unknown.&#x0D;
Methodology: Using a descriptive case study approach, this investigation focused on a sample of injured athletes (n = 75) in Uganda from four main sports associations (football, athletics, basketball and rugby). The data were collected through observations and interviews after the injury. Using a best medical practice framework the phases of emergency, intermediate, rehabilitative, and return-to-sports participation were described.&#x0D;
Result: Nine conditions/types of injury were included. The results revealed a lack of specific pre-season screening or re- turn-to-play readiness for all the injured athletes. Further, there was a lack of application of best practice principles for most of the injury types. For athletes who received medical care, the results show inconsistencies and inadequacies from the acute stage of the injury to return-to-sports participation.&#x0D;
Conclusion: This study identified barriers such as up-to-date knowledge among the sports resource providers; the gaps for appropriate and adequate specific facilities for managing injured athletes, and policies to mandate care of injured athletes. These barriers detract from applying best medical practices.&#x0D;

In this paper, we report on a study to design an omnichannel distribution system for Total Hockey, a growing U.S. sporting goods retailer in a competitive environment. Management strongly believes that e-commerce success will depend on high service levels characterized by one- or two-day delivery and initially thought that a new omnichannel warehouse located on the East Coast could support its expansion plans. To study the situation, we developed a profit-maximizing optimization model for locating omnichannel warehouses that supports both e-commerce and store shipments. The model uses estimates of e-commerce demand by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) across the United States, while incorporating management’s sales expectations regarding the value of high service levels, e-commerce sales lost to competitors’ stores, and reverse cannibalism from Total Hockey’s own retail stores. Multiple warehouse sizes allow modeling of nonlinear inventory costs. The facility-location optimization model allows exploration of multiple solutions and an assessment of the impact of higher service levels. The results of the study were contrary to management expectations and suggested a significant redesign of the distribution system. We report results for several analyses, implementation details, and managerial insights for omnichannel distribution. ",,,,

          Poverty has detrimental effects on health outcomes. Doctorally prepared nurse practitioners are in a position to promote health for patients and communities experiencing poverty. To do so, they must be aware of their own attitudes and to have empathy toward the condition of poverty. Specialized poverty simulations have been successfully used to improve attitudes toward poverty among prelicensure nursing students, but there is a paucity of evidence exploring the effects of poverty simulations among Students in a Doctor of Nurse Practice (DNP) program. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a poverty simulation for students enrolled in a DNP program on their attitudes toward poverty. A quasi-experimental, pre-test and post-test survey design was used in this curriculum improvement project. A total of 29 DNP students participated in a 1-time, 4-hour Community Action Poverty Simulation© (CAPS). The simulations presented various challenges faced during 1 month of living in poverty. The Attitudes toward Poverty Scale-Short Form (ATPS-SF) was used to measure attitudes toward poverty both before and after the CAPS© experience. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were used to describe the participant group and measure the impact of the simulation on attitudes toward poverty. Attitudes toward poverty improved overall on all dimensions of the ATPS-SF after the CAPS© experience as compared to the pre-test, with particular improvement regarding stigmas related to poverty. Statistically significant improvements were detected on four items, and the overall favorable shift in attitudes presents clinically significant results. This poverty simulation experience should be considered for adoption into DNP curricula.",,,,

Abstract  Infection by lineages of avian malaria parasites (Apicomplexa: Haemosporida) varies geographically, and some lineages exhibit disjunct distributions. These patterns might be related to differential resistance among host populations reflecting intrinsic characteristics of both the host and the pathogen. In hematophagous parasites in particular, the structure of host hemoglobin can influence parasite development and reproduction. Though variation in avian hemoglobin has been documented across altitudinal gradients, little is known about hemoglobin variation as it relates to infection by the parasites causing avian malaria. We sequenced the αA-globin subunit of the Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), and related sequence variation to avian malaria infection frequency and parasite lineage identity. We found no association between αA-globin haplotype and infection by particular parasite lineages among all locations, nor any protective association between globin haplotype frequency and the proportion of individuals infected within populations. Phylogeographic structure and genetic variation at the αA-globin locus, including a highly variable intron, is largely concordant with the mitochondrial cytochrome b locus for these same populations, supporting this marker as an independent and variable target with potential application in biogeographic analyses.&#x0D;

Resumen  La variación de la globina alfa no predice la infección por malaria aviar en Coereba flaveola • La infección por linajes de parásitos de la malaria aviar (Apicomplexa: Haemosporida) varía geográficamente y algunos linajes exhiben distribuciones discontinuas. Estos patrones podrían estar relacionados con la resistencia diferencial entre las poblaciones de huéspedes, y reflejan las características intrínsecas tanto del huésped como del patógeno. En los parásitos hematófagos, en particular, la estructura de la hemoglobina del huésped puede influir en el desarrollo y la reproducción del parásito. Aunque se ha documentado la variación de la hemoglobina aviar a través de gradientes altitudinales, se sabe poco sobre su variación en relación con la infección por los parásitos que causan la malaria aviar. Secuenciamos la subunidad de globina αA de Coereba flaveola y relacionamos la variación de la secuencia con la frecuencia de infección por malaria aviar y la identidad del linaje del parásito. No encontramos ninguna asociación entre el haplotipo de globina αA y la infección por determinados linajes de parásitos entre localidades; ni ninguna asociación protectora entre la frecuencia del haplotipo de globina y la proporción de individuos infectados dentro de las poblaciones. La estructura filogeográfica y la variación genética en el locus de la globina αA, que incluye un intrón muy variable, concuerdan en gran medida con el locus del citocromo b mitocondrial para estas mismas poblaciones; lo que respalda a este marcador como un objetivo independiente y variable con aplicación potencial en análisis biogeográficos.&#x0D;

Résumé  La variation de l’alpha-globine ne permet pas de prédire l’infection par le paludisme aviaire chez le Sucrier à ventre jaune (Coereba flaveola) • L’infection par des lignées de parasites responsables du paludisme aviaire (Apicomplexa: Haemosporida) varie géographiquement, et certaines lignées présentent des répartitions disjointes. Ces schémas pourraient être liés à une résistance différentielle entre les populations d’hôtes reflétant des caractéristiques intrinsèques à la fois de l’hôte et du pathogène. Dans le cas particulier des parasites hématophages, la structure de l’hémoglobine de l’hôte peut influer sur le développe- ment et la reproduction du parasite. Bien que la variation de l’hémoglobine aviaire ait été documentée en fonction des gradients altitudinaux, peu de choses sont connues sur la variation de l’hémoglobine en relation avec l’infection par les parasites responsables du paludisme aviaire. Nous avons séquencé la sous-unité αA-globine du Sucrier à ventre jaune (Coereba flaveola), et nous avons mis en relation la variation de la séquence avec la fréquence d’infection du paludisme aviaire et l’identité de la lignée parasitaire. Nous n’avons trouvé aucune association entre l’haplotype αA-globine et l’infection par des lignées parasitaires particulières en fonction des sites, ni aucune association protectrice entre la fréquence de l’haplotype globine et la proportion d’individus infectés au sein des populations. La structure phylogéographique et la variation génétique au locus de l’αA-globine, y compris un intron hautement variable, est largement concordante avec le locus du cytochrome b mitochondrial pour ces mêmes populations, indiquant ce marqueur comme une cible indépendante et variable pouvant avoir une application potentielle dans les analyses biogéographiques.&#x0D;

Results from a statewide assessment of the first year of State Targeted Response implementation showed increases and improvements in overall treatment admissions, medication utilization, and treatment retention. The current study, which focuses on the St. Louis region, the epicenter of Missouri’s overdose crisis, examines whether improvements were experienced equally among Black and White clients. Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis using state-level billing records for individuals with OUD receiving services through publicly-funded substance use treatment programs between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2019, with claimed services updated through November 1, 2020. Comparisons across time periods, treatment groups, and Black and White clients were assessed using chi-square tests of independence and multivariate negative binomial regressions. Results: White individuals in St. Louis experienced larger increases in treatment admissions and utilization of medications for OUD than Black individuals, and Black clients were retained in treatment for shorter lengths of time than White clients. Conclusion: In Missouri, rates of drug overdose deaths are more than three times higher for Black people than White people. Racial inequities in OUD treatment utilization and retention must be intentionally targeted and corrected as one component of reducing this sizable disparity in fatalities. ",,,,
Does a Crossover Age Effect Exist for African American and Hispanic Binge Drinkers,2017.0,"[{'given': 'Tamika C B', 'family': 'Zapolski', 'name': 'Tamika C B Zapolski'}, {'given': 'Patrick', 'family': 'Baldwin', 'name': 'Patrick Baldwin'}, {'given': 'Devin E', 'family': 'Banks', 'name': 'Devin E Banks'}, {'given': 'Timothy E', 'family': 'Stump', 'name': 'Timothy E Stump'}]","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",10.1111/acer.13380,journal-article,0145-6008,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,Wiley,6,41,1129-1136,2017-06-01,"['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Toxicology', 'Medicine (miscellaneous)']","<h4>Background</h4>Among general population studies, lower rates of binge drinking tend to be found among African Americans and Hispanics compared to Whites. However, among older adult populations, minority groups have been shown to be at higher risk for binge drinking, suggesting the presence of a crossover effect from low to high risk as a function of age. To date, limited research has examined the crossover effect among African American and Hispanic populations compared to non-Hispanic Whites across large developmental time frames or explored variation in risk based on income or gender. This study aimed to fill these gaps in the literature.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were compiled from the 2010 to 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health surveys, which provide annual, nationally representative data on substance use behaviors among individuals aged 12 and older. Hispanic, non-Hispanic African American, and non-Hispanic White respondents were included (N = 205,198) in the analyses.<h4>Results</h4>A crossover effect was found for African American males and females among the lowest income level (i.e., incomes less than $20,000). Specifically, after controlling for education and marital status, compared to Whites, risk for binge drinking was lower for African American males at ages 18 to 24 and for females at ages 18 to 34, but higher for both African American males and females at ages 50 to 64. No crossover effect was found for Hispanic respondents.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although African Americans are generally at lower risk for binge drinking, risk appears to increase disproportionately with age among those who are impoverished.

                Background
                This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on work satisfaction, work-related stress, and perceived work quality among substance use treatment providers to better understand challenges faced among this group during the pandemic.
              
                Methods
                Participants of this study were 91 addiction treatment providers (e.g., therapists, physicians, community support specialists, administrative staff) recruited from various treatment facilities (e.g., inpatient and outpatient settings). Mixed method analyses were conducted to assess self-reported burnout, sources of work-related stress, and perceived work quality during the pandemic. Responses from providers reporting COVID-19 related decreases in work quality were compared to responses from providers who reported their quality of work had increased or remained the same.
              
                Results
                Results demonstrated half of providers (51%) reported their quality of work had decreased. This perceived decrease in quality of work was associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion (M = 17.41 vs. M = 12.48, p = 0.002), workplace stress (M = 42.80 vs. M = 30.84, p = 0.001), as well as decreased enjoyment of work (83% vs. 51%, p = 0.001) and decreased personal accomplishment (M = 20.64 vs. M = 23.05 p = 0.001). Qualitative investigations further illustrated that increased hours, changes in work schedules, work-life balance challenges, difficulties with client communication, and increased client needs were contributing factors increasing stress/burnout and decreasing perceived work quality.
              
                Conclusions
                Addiction treatment providers experience high levels of burnout and workplace stress. Additionally, many individuals perceived a decrease in their quality of work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addiction treatment facility administration should address these challenges to support the well-being of clinical staff and the clients they serve both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Background
                Black individuals in the USA face disproportionate increases in rates of fatal opioid overdose despite federal efforts to mitigate the opioid crisis. The aim of this study was to examine what drives increases in opioid overdose death among Black Americans based on the experience of key stakeholders.

              
                Methods
                Focus groups were conducted with stakeholders providing substance use prevention services in Black communities in St. Louis, MO (n = 14). One focus group included peer advocates and volunteers conducting outreach-based services and one included active community health workers. Focus groups were held at community partner organizations familiar to participants. Data collection was facilitated by an interview guide with open-ended prompts. Focus groups were audio recorded and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory to abstract line-by-line codes into higher order themes and interpret their associations.
              
                Results
                A core theme was identified from participants’ narratives suggesting that opioid overdose death among Black individuals is driven by unmet needs for safety, security, stability, and survival (The 4Ss). A lack of The 4Ss was reflective of structural disinvestment and healthcare and social service barriers perpetuated by systemic racism. Participants unmet 4S needs are associated with health and social consequences that perpetuate overdose and detrimentally impact recovery efforts. Participants identified cultural and relationship-based strategies that may address The 4Ss and mitigate overdose in Black communities.
              
                Conclusions
                Key stakeholders working in local communities to address racial inequities in opioid overdose highlighted the importance of upstream interventions that promote basic socioeconomic needs. Local outreach efforts utilizing peer services can provide culturally congruent interventions and promote harm reduction in Black communities traditionally underserved by US health and social systems.

            Objectives
            Pregnant and postpartum women and people (PPWP) who use opioids experience higher rates of morbidity, preterm labor, and stillbirth than those who do not. Although medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is the standard of treatment, utilization among PPWP has remained low because of MOUD stigma and misconceptions. The current report examined general and pregnancy-related MOUD attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy among PPWP seeking treatment.
          
          
            Methods
            Participants (n = 33) receiving MOUD at a Midwestern clinic reported beliefs about MOUD in general using the Attitudes toward Methadone Questionnaire (modified to include all MOUD) and during pregnancy/postpartum using an investigator-generated scale based on previous research. Participants responded using a 5-point scale from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree” with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes. Analyses examined the bivariate association of attitudes with MOUD subjective norms and self-efficacy, also measured via investigator-generated scales.
          
          
            Results
            Respondents reported positive attitudes toward MOUD use during pregnancy, with most agreeing it was safe. However, up-to-half of participants reported uncertainty regarding the appropriate dosage of MOUD and its impact on the fetus and/or neonate. Both general and pregnancy/postpartum-related MOUD attitudes were positively associated with subjective norms toward MOUD.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Pregnant and postpartum women and people reported high uncertainty about MOUD use despite currently using it, emphasizing the need for strategies that assess and mitigate MOUD-related stigma. Findings suggest that familial support and stigma impact attitudes toward MOUD and highlight the importance of accurate psychoeducation and social supports for patients and their families to improve the acceptance and utilization of MOUD among PPWP.

Currently, there is lack of research that explores comorbid factors associated with substance use, such as post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, that could help identify youth who are at greatest risk. The aim of the present study was to examine if PTSD symptomology moderated the relationship between substance use disorder (SUD) symptoms and externalizing behaviors and commission of a violent crime; hypothesizing that risk would be heightened among youth with elevated SUD and PTSD symptomology compared to those with elevated SUD symptoms but lower PTSD symptoms.MethodThe study included 194 predominantly male (78.4%), non‐White (74.2%) juvenile justice youth between the ages of 9–18 (M = 15.36). Youth provided responses to assess PTSD symptoms, SUD symptoms, and externalizing behaviors. Commission of a violent crime was based on parole officer report.ResultsFindings indicated that SUD symptomology was associated with greater externalizing behaviors at high levels of PTSD symptomology. At low levels of PTSD symptomology, SUD symptoms were inversely associated with externalizing behaviors. An interactive relationship was not observed for commission of violent crimes.ConclusionsFindings suggest that the association between SUD symptoms and externalizing behaviors among juvenile offenders may be best explained by the presence of PTSD symptomology.Scientific SignificanceAddressing PTSD rather than SUD symptoms may be a better target for reducing risk for externalizing behaviors among this population of youth (Am J Addict 2019;28:29–35).",,,,
